## Style Guide Essentials

- **Person**: First person plural ("we", "our") for VITAL team perspective

### Terminology Standards

**Approved Terms** (use these):
- VITAL Platform (not "VITAL", "Vital", or "VITAL platform")
- Medical Affairs (capitalized)
- Ask Expert (capitalized, our feature name)
- Ask Panel (capitalized)
- BYOAI (Bring Your Own AI - always capitalized acronym)
- Elastic Organization (capitalized, our coined term)
- Human Amplification (capitalized when referring to our philosophy)
- Multi-Tenant (hyphenated)

**Terms to Avoid**:
- "AI replacement" (say "Human Amplification")
- "Chatbot" (say "Expert Agent" or "AI Agent")
- "Medical device" (we are NOT a medical device)
- "Diagnose", "Treat", "Cure" (medical claims we don't make)

### Formatting Conventions
- **Headings**: Title Case (# Title, ## Subtitle)
- **Lists**: Parallel structure, complete sentences or fragments (not mixed)
- **Code**: Backticks for inline code, fenced code blocks for multi-line
- **Bold**: For emphasis, key terms (first usage)
- **Italics**: For de-emphasis, foreign terms
- **Links**: Descriptive text, not "click here"

### Visual Standards
- **Diagrams**: ASCII art or standard diagramming tool (Mermaid, Lucidchart)
- **Tables**: Markdown tables, header row, left-aligned text, right-aligned numbers
- **Code Snippets**: Syntax highlighting, line numbers for long snippets
- **Charts**: Clear labels, legend, source citation

---

## Special Considerations

### Multi-Tenant Consistency
- Ensure all documents consistently describe 4 tenant types
- Verify RLS (Row-Level Security) is mentioned consistently
- Check that multi-tenant examples are accurate

### Regulatory Language
- Ensure no medical device language (diagnose, treat, cure)
- Verify "HIPAA-aware, NOT HIPAA-regulated" phrasing consistent
- Check compliance language is accurate

### Human Amplification Philosophy
- Verify core philosophy is consistent across all documents
- Check that "Human-in-Control, Human-in-the-Loop, Human-Machine Synthesis" is accurate
- Ensure no language suggests human replacement

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify "The Golden Rule" (all AI/ML in Python) is stated consistently
- Check technology stack is accurate across all documents
- Validate all architecture diagrams are consistent
