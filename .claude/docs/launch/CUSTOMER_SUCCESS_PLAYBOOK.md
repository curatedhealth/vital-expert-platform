                    WEIGHT    CALCULATION
Usage Score         30%       Based on MAU, query volume

```

### 2.2 Detailed Score Calculations

| Query Volume | 30% | Above target = 100, At target = 75, Below = 50 |
| Feature Breadth | 20% | 3+ modes = 100, 2 modes = 75, 1 mode = 50 |

## Part 3: Adoption Playbooks

### 3.1 Low Adoption Playbook

**Trigger**: MAU <40% after 30 days

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
□ Training gap - Users don't know how to use
□ Value gap - Users don't see the benefit
□ Access gap - Users can't access easily
□ Champion gap - No internal advocate
□ Use case gap - Wrong use cases identified
```

**Action Plan:**

| Week | Actions | Owner |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Call with champion to understand barriers | CSM |
| 1 | Review usage data by user | CSM |
| 2 | Offer targeted training for low-usage users | CSM |
| 2 | Identify and empower super users | CSM |
| 3 | Executive check-in if no improvement | CSM + Manager |
| 4 | Escalate to renewal risk if <50% MAU | CSM + Manager |

**Canned Outreach (Low Adoption):**
```
Subject: Quick check-in on VITAL Platform

Hi [Champion Name],

I noticed some of the team hasn't had a chance to try VITAL yet.
I wanted to reach out and see if there's anything I can help with.

Common reasons teams don't engage initially:
• Not sure when to use it (I can share specific use cases)
• Haven't had time for training (I can do 15-min sessions)
• Login/access issues (easy to fix!)

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick sync? I'd love to
understand what's working and what barriers exist.

[Calendar Link]

Best,
[CSM Name]
```
