## The Challenge

Life sciences organizations face a critical gap between the evidence they have and the decisions they need to make:

## The VITAL Approach

We use a structured, platform-powered methodology to identify and prioritize GenAI opportunities:

### The VITAL Journey

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Outcome |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| **V** Value Discovery | Map organization, identify pain points | Week 1 | Prioritized focus areas |
| **I** Investigate & Ideate | Score AI suitability, quantify value | Week 2-3 | Opportunity portfolio |
| **T** Trial & Test | Run pilots, validate business case | Week 4-6 | Proof of value |
| **A** Adopt & Accelerate | Deploy solutions, enable users | Week 7-12 | Scaled adoption |
| **L** Learn & Lead | Capture insights, expand scope | Ongoing | Continuous improvement |

---

## What Makes This Different

### 1. Ontology-Anchored Discovery

We don't start with technology—we start with your organization:

```
Function (Medical Affairs)
    └── Department (Global Strategy)
        └── Role (Strategic Planning Lead)
            └── Job-to-be-Done (Prioritize therapeutic areas)
                └── AI Opportunity (Evidence synthesis: 92% automatable)
                    └── Value Impact (SMARTER decisions, $2.5M/year)
```

Every AI opportunity maps directly to business outcomes.

### 2. Quantified Prioritization

We score opportunities across two dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Measures | How We Assess |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **AI Suitability** | Can AI actually do this well? | Data quality, process standardization, error tolerance, complexity |
| **Value Impact** | Is this worth doing? | Time savings, decision quality, risk reduction, revenue impact |

**Result**: A prioritized portfolio, not a wish list.

### 3. Persona-Adapted Solutions

Not everyone adopts AI the same way. We identify four user archetypes:

| Archetype | Profile | Approach |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Automator** | High AI maturity, routine work | Give them workflows to scale |
| **Orchestrator** | High AI maturity, strategic work | Give them multi-expert synthesis |
| **Learner** | Low AI maturity, routine work | Give them guided, supportive AI |
| **Skeptic** | Low AI maturity, strategic work | Give them transparency and control |

## Expected Outcomes

### From a 2-Week Discovery Sprint

| Deliverable | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Organizational mapping to VITAL ontology | Shared language for AI opportunities |
| 10-15 identified opportunities | Comprehensive view of potential |
| Top 3 prioritized with business cases | Clear starting point |
| Pilot design for #1 opportunity | Ready to validate |

### From a 12-Week Transformation Program

| Outcome | Typical Range |
|---------|---------------|
| Hours saved per user per week | 5-10 hours |
| Decision time reduction | 50-80% |
| Annual value realized | $1-5M+ |
| User adoption rate | 60-80% |

## The Platform Advantage

Discovery is powered by the VITAL Ontology Explorer—an interactive visualization that:

- **Navigates** your organization from function to department to role
- **Scores** each job-to-be-done for AI suitability
- **Connects** opportunities to value categories (SMARTER, FASTER, BETTER...)
- **Recommends** specific AI agents for each opportunity
- **Tracks** adoption and impact over time
