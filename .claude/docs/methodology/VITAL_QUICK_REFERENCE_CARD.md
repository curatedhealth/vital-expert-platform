### Key Discovery Questions

**For Decision Inventory:**
1. "What are the 3 most consequential decisions your team makes each quarter?"
2. "For each decision, what evidence do you wish you had?"
3. "What happens when you don't have that evidence?"

**For Pain Points:**
1. "Where do you spend time that feels like waste?"
2. "What information do you need but can't get fast enough?"
3. "What tasks do you wish someone else could do for you?"

**For Value Quantification:**
1. "If we could cut the time for [task] in half, what would that be worth?"
2. "What's the cost of a delayed decision in your area?"
3. "How many hours per week do you spend on [pain point]?"

| **Process Standardization** | Ad-hoc, varies | Documented, consistent |
| **Error Tolerance** | Critical, no room | Easily caught/corrected |
| **Cognitive Complexity** | Deep expertise | Pattern-based |

**Overall AI Suitability = (D1 + D2 + D3 + D4) / 4 × 10**

### ROI Quick Calculation

```
Annual Value = Hours Saved × Rate × Users
             + Quality Gain × Revenue Impact
             + Risk Reduction × Avoided Cost

Example:
5 hrs/wk × 48 wks × 50 users × $100/hr = $1.2M (efficiency)
10% better decisions × $50M portfolio  = $500K (quality)
20% fewer issues × $2M × 2 issues/yr   = $800K (risk)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL: $2.5M annually
```

### Red Flags to Watch For

⚠️ **"We want to use AI for everything"** → Focus on 2-3 high-value opportunities first

⚠️ **"Just tell us what to do"** → They need to own the prioritization; use voting

⚠️ **"Our data is too messy"** → Start with well-structured use cases to build confidence

⚠️ **"IT won't let us"** → Engage IT early; position as augmentation, not replacement

⚠️ **"We tried AI and it didn't work"** → Dig into what failed; often it's change management
