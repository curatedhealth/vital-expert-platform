# Capability-to-Skill Mapping: Medical Affairs
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: November 27, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Purpose**: Map 60 Medical Affairs capabilities to granular skills as parent-child hierarchy

---

## Overview

This document defines the hierarchical mapping between **capabilities** (parent) and **skills** (child).

**Relationship**: 
- **Capability** = High-level "what you can do" (e.g., "MSL Core Competency - KOL Engagement")
- **Skill** = Granular "how you do it" (e.g., "Stakeholder Mapping", "Scientific Discussion Facilitation", "Needs Assessment")

**Strategy**:
- Each capability maps to 5-10 granular skills
- Skills are reusable across multiple capabilities
- Total unique skills: ~200-250 for Medical Affairs
