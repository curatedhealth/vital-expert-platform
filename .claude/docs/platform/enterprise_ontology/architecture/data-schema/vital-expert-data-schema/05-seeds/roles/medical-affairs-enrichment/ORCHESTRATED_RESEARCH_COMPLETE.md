## Technical Implementation Roadmap

### Step 1: Database Query for Actual Role IDs

**Current state:** Phase 2 & 3 use "TBD" placeholders
**Required action:** Query org_roles table for actual UUIDs

```sql
-- Get Medical Information role IDs
SELECT id, name, geographic_scope, seniority_level
FROM org_roles
WHERE department_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM org_departments
  WHERE department_name = 'Medical Information'
)
ORDER BY name;

-- Get Scientific Communications role IDs
SELECT id, name, geographic_scope, seniority_level
FROM org_roles
WHERE department_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM org_departments
  WHERE department_name = 'Scientific Communications'
)
ORDER BY name;
```

### Step 2: Transform JSON to SQL

Use the transformation pattern from Phase 1:

```sql
-- Example for Medical Information Specialist
UPDATE org_roles
SET
  description = '...',
  required_skills = ARRAY[...],
  required_certifications = ARRAY[...],
  -- ... all 54 attributes
WHERE id = '<actual-uuid-from-database>';

INSERT INTO role_regulatory_frameworks (role_id, framework_id, proficiency_level)
SELECT '<role-uuid>', id, '<proficiency>'
FROM regulatory_frameworks
WHERE name = '<framework-name>';

-- Repeat for GxP training, competencies, KPIs
```

### Step 3: Validate Before Import

```sql
-- Check for NULL critical fields
SELECT name,
  CASE
    WHEN description IS NULL THEN 'Missing description'
    WHEN array_length(required_skills, 1) IS NULL THEN 'Missing skills'
    ELSE 'OK'
  END as status
FROM org_roles
WHERE department_id IN ('<medical-info-dept-id>', '<sci-comm-dept-id>')
AND (description IS NULL OR array_length(required_skills, 1) IS NULL);
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Supabase

```bash
# 1. Seed reference data (if not already done)
psql $DATABASE_URL -f 00_run_all_reference_data_seeds.sql

# 2. Generate SQL from JSON
python transform_enrichment_to_sql.py phase2_medical_information_enrichment.json

# 3. Execute enrichment
psql $DATABASE_URL -f phase2_enrichment.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f phase3_enrichment.sql

# 4. Validate
psql $DATABASE_URL -f validate_enrichment.sql
```
