**Job Category:**
- Functional Jobs: Getting work done (70% of JTBDs)
- Emotional Jobs: How they want to feel (15% of JTBDs)
- Social Jobs: How they want to be perceived (15% of JTBDs)

**Job Type:**
- Routine: High-frequency, repeatable tasks

---

### 3. OUTCOMES PER JTBD

Each JTBD has **3-4 defined outcomes** with:
- **Outcome Statement:** Specific, measurable result
- **Direction:** minimize, maximize, or optimize
- **Measurement Type:** time, quality, frequency, cost, accuracy

**Example (JTBD-MSL-001: Pre-Meeting Preparation):**
1. Minimize time spent searching for relevant information (time)
2. Maximize comprehensiveness of background research (quality)
3. Maximize relevance of discussion topics to KOL's interests (quality)
4. Minimize risk of missing important context (quality)

---

### 4. ODI SCORING FRAMEWORK

**Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) Methodology:**

```
Opportunity Score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)

Interpretation:
- 50+:  Critical opportunity (under-served, high importance)
- 35-49: High opportunity
- 20-34: Medium opportunity
- <20:   Low opportunity (over-served or low importance)
```

**Scores vary by archetype:**
- **AUTOMATOR:** Highest opportunity on documentation/admin tasks
- **ORCHESTRATOR:** Highest opportunity on synthesis/strategic analysis
- **LEARNER:** Highest opportunity on learning/guidance needs
- **SKEPTIC:** More satisfied overall, but critical on compliance/validation

---

### 5. ARCHETYPE VARIATIONS

#### AUTOMATOR (High AI + Routine Work)
**"Power User" - Seeks efficiency**
- **Focus:** Eliminating repetitive tasks, scaling productivity
- **Typical JTBDs:** "When I do the same task repeatedly, I want to automate it..."
- **Outcome Priorities:** Time minimization, consistency maximization
- **ODI Patterns:** +1 to +2 importance on time-saving, -1 to -2 satisfaction on manual processes

#### ORCHESTRATOR (High AI + Strategic Work)
**"Visionary" - Drives innovation**
- **Focus:** Multi-source synthesis, strategic insights
- **Typical JTBDs:** "When I analyze complex situations, I want to synthesize across sources..."
- **Outcome Priorities:** Comprehensiveness, insight quality
- **ODI Patterns:** +2 to +3 importance on synthesis, -2 to -3 satisfaction on siloed data

#### LEARNER (Low AI + Routine Work)
**"Beginner" - Needs guidance**
- **Focus:** Learning safely, avoiding mistakes, building confidence
- **Typical JTBDs:** "When I try new AI tools, I want step-by-step guidance..."
- **Outcome Priorities:** Error minimization, guidance maximization
- **ODI Patterns:** +1 to +2 importance on guidance, -2 to -3 satisfaction (high onboarding opportunity)

#### SKEPTIC (Low AI + Strategic Work)
**"Traditionalist" - Requires proof**
- **Focus:** Verification, validation, risk mitigation
- **Typical JTBDs:** "When I evaluate AI outputs, I want to verify sources..."
- **Outcome Priorities:** Accuracy maximization, error minimization
- **ODI Patterns:** +2 to +3 importance on validation, -3 to -4 satisfaction on black-box AI

---

### 6. SERVICE LAYER ROUTING

Each JTBD × Archetype combination is mapped to optimal service layer:

#### ASK_EXPERT
**Best For:** Complex questions, guidance, coaching, single-expert perspective
- **LEARNER:** Primary service (guidance, examples)
- **SKEPTIC:** With verification features (citations, expert credentials)
- **Examples:** "Coach me on KOL engagement strategy," "Explain regulatory pathway options"

#### ASK_PANEL
**Best For:** Multi-perspective synthesis, strategic decisions, cross-domain analysis
- **ORCHESTRATOR:** Primary service (strategic synthesis)
- **SKEPTIC:** With multi-source validation
- **Examples:** "Synthesize competitive intelligence across clinical/commercial/regulatory"

#### WORKFLOWS
**Best For:** Routine, repeatable tasks, template-based processes, automation
- **AUTOMATOR:** Primary service (routine automation)
- **LEARNER:** With guided templates and examples
- **Examples:** "Auto-generate meeting briefings," "Capture and format CRM documentation"

#### SOLUTION_BUILDER
**Best For:** Custom deliverables, multi-step projects, comprehensive packages
- **ORCHESTRATOR:** Primary service (strategic deliverables)
- **AUTOMATOR:** For reusable solution templates
