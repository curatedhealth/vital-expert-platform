## Use Cases for Personas

### Use Case 1: Personalized AI Interactions

**Scenario**: Sarah (AUTOMATOR MSL) vs. Dr. Raj (SKEPTIC VP) ask the same question

**Question**: "What are the latest safety data for Drug X?"

**Sarah (AUTOMATOR) Response**:
- **Service**: Ask Expert Mode 1 (single expert, quick)
- **Tone**: Efficient, data-focused, actionable
- **Format**: Bulleted summary with automated export to PowerPoint
- **Workflow**: Auto-save to "Recent Queries" for fast access later
- **Output**: "Here's a quick summary with 3 key safety findings. Exported to your Templates folder."

**Dr. Raj (SKEPTIC) Response**:
- **Service**: Hybrid Human-AI Panel (AI analysis + human validation)
- **Tone**: Detailed, transparent, with full sourcing
- **Format**: Comprehensive narrative with full citation trail
- **Workflow**: Human expert reviews AI findings before presentation
- **Output**: "I've analyzed 12 recent studies. Here's a detailed synthesis. Would you like our Chief Medical Officer to review this analysis before you proceed?"

**Persona Impact**: Same question, completely different experience based on persona archetype.

---

### Use Case 2: Predictive Workflow Optimization

**Scenario**: VITAL predicts Elena (LEARNER MSL) will struggle with complex Ask Panel workflow

**Prediction Logic**:
- Persona archetype: LEARNER (low AI maturity, routine work)
- Workflow requested: Ask Panel Type 3 (Socratic, complex)
- Complexity mismatch detected

**Adaptive Response**:
1. **Warning**: "This is an advanced workflow. Would you like a guided tutorial first?"
2. **Offer Simpler Alternative**: "For this question, Ask Expert Mode 2 (single expert) might be easier to start."
3. **Provide Step-by-Step Guide**: If user proceeds, add extra tooltips and explanations
4. **Follow-Up Support**: Auto-schedule a check-in message: "How did that go? Need any help?"

**Outcome**: Elena feels supported, not overwhelmed. Learns gradually rather than abandoning the tool.

---

### Use Case 3: Product Development Prioritization

**Scenario**: Product team deciding which features to build next

**Analysis Using Personas**:

```
Feature: Advanced AI Workflow Builder (BYOAI)

Target Personas:
- ORCHESTRATOR (High AI + Strategic): 25% of users
  - VPANES Score: 50 (Ideal!)
  - Willingness to pay: High ($500+/month)

- AUTOMATOR (High AI + Routine): 30% of users
  - VPANES Score: 35 (Medium - might use it occasionally)
  - Willingness to pay: Moderate ($200/month)

Not For:
- LEARNER (Low AI + Routine): 25% of users
  - VPANES Score: 15 (Low - too complex)

- SKEPTIC (Low AI + Strategic): 20% of users
  - VPANES Score: 10 (Very low - won't trust it)

Decision: Build for ORCHESTRATOR first (highest VPANES, highest WTP), add simplified version for AUTOMATOR later.
```

**Impact**: Data-driven product roadmap based on quantified persona fit.
