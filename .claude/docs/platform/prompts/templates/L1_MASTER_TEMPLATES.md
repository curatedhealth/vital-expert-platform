## Comparison: L1 vs L2 Prompts

| Aspect | L1 (Head of Function) | L2 (Head of Department) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Scope** | Function-wide | Department-wide |
| **Example** | CMO strategic plan | MSL Ops territory alignment |
| **Stakeholders** | C-suite, board, external | Function head, peer depts |
| **Resources** | Function budget ($28M) | Department budget ($4M) |
| **Time horizon** | Annual/multi-year | Monthly/quarterly |
| **Deliverable** | Strategic recommendations | Operational plans |

### Same Topic, Different Levels

**Topic: MSL Resource Allocation**

**L1 (CMO):**
```
"Allocate MSL resources across 5 therapeutic areas and 45 territories to maximize scientific leadership and support 3 upcoming launches while maintaining lifecycle engagement for mature products"
```

**L2 (Head of MSL Ops):**
```
"Design Q1 2025 MSL territory realignment for the oncology team to support Asset B launch at 30 target sites while maintaining Asset A coverage"
```
