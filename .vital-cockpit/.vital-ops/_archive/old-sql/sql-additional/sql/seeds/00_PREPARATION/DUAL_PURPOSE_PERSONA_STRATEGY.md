# DUAL-PURPOSE MEDICAL AFFAIRS PERSONAS
## Individual Personalization + Enterprise Opportunity Mapping

**Date**: 2025-11-16
**Purpose**: Create 3-5 persona variants per medical affairs role
**Total Personas**: 15-25 across 5 roles
**Schema**: v5.0 (69 tables)

---

## STRATEGIC APPROACH

### Persona Variant Strategy

For each of the 5 medical affairs roles, create 3-5 variants that represent:

1. **Different Seniority Levels** (Junior → Senior → Executive)
2. **Different Organization Sizes** (Startup → Small → Mid → Large → Enterprise)
3. **Different Specializations** (Therapeutic areas, functional focus)
4. **Different Geographic Markets** (US, EU, APAC, Emerging)
5. **Different Career Stages** (Early career → Mid-career → Late career)

This enables:
- **Better AI personalization** - Match user to most similar persona archetype
- **Account mapping** - Understand full spectrum of roles within client org
- **Expansion planning** - Identify adjacent personas for cross-sell
- **Service tiering** - Different personas need different service layers
