## 🎯 JTBD STATEMENT FORMAT

**Template:**
```
When [situation/context], I want to [action/capability], so I can [desired outcome/goal]
```

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
- "When preparing annual strategic planning, I want to synthesize evidence gaps, competitive intelligence, and stakeholder insights, so I can define a 3-5 year Medical Affairs roadmap aligned with business objectives"
- "When managing my MSL territory, I want to prioritize high-value KOLs and plan engagement frequency, so I can maximize scientific exchange impact within my coverage area"

❌ **Bad:**
- "Strategic planning" (too vague)
- "I need better data" (not JTBD format)
- "Create reports for leadership" (missing context and outcome)

## 💡 DEVELOPMENT TIPS

### **1. Start with High-Impact JTBDs:**
Focus on Critical and High impact JTBDs first. These will have the most value.

### **2. Think Persona-First:**
Ask: "What does [Persona] need to accomplish?" rather than "What tasks exist?"

### **3. Be Specific:**
Instead of "Create reports," write "When preparing monthly KPIs, I want to automate data aggregation from 5+ systems, so I can reduce reporting time from 8 hours to 2 hours"

### **4. Link to Strategic Pillars:**
Every JTBD should clearly support at least one strategic pillar.

### **5. Make Success Criteria Measurable:**
Use specific targets: ">85%", "<2 weeks", ">4.0/5", "±10%"
