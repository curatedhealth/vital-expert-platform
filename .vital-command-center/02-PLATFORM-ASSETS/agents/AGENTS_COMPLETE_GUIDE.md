## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Agent (Ask Expert Mode 1)
**Use Case**: Quick answer from one expert

```
User Question → Agent Selection → Single Agent Response
```

**Example**:
- User: "What's the latest on CAR-T therapies for lymphoma?"
- Agent: Oncology Clinical Development Agent
- Response: Evidence-based summary with citations

---

### Pattern 2: Sequential Panel (Ask Panel Type 1)
**Use Case**: Structured expert discussion

```
User Question → Moderator Agent → Expert 1 → Expert 2 → ... → Moderator Synthesis
```

**Example**:
- User: "Should we proceed to Phase 3 for Drug X?"
- Panel: Moderator + Clinical Dev + Regulatory + Medical + Safety + Finance
- Output: Sequential analysis with final recommendation

---

### Pattern 3: Parallel Exploration (Ask Panel Type 2)
**Use Case**: Brainstorming and innovation

```
User Question → Facilitator → [Expert 1, Expert 2, ..., Expert N] (parallel)
                           → Facilitator Synthesis
```

**Example**:
- User: "What are innovative digital health solutions for diabetes?"
- Panel: Digital Health + Endocrinology + UX + Health Econ + Behavioral Science
- Output: 15-20 diverse ideas clustered into themes

---

### Pattern 4: Adversarial Debate (Ask Panel Type 4)
**Use Case**: Go/no-go decisions

```
User Question → Moderator → [Advocates] vs [Opponents] → Rebuttals → Recommendation
```

**Example**:
- User: "Should we acquire Company X for $500M?"
- Advocates: 3 agents arguing FOR
- Opponents: 3 agents arguing AGAINST
- Output: Balanced pro/con analysis with recommendation

## Agent Selection Algorithm

### Mode 1: Manual Selection
**User explicitly chooses agent**

```python
# User selects from agent catalog
selected_agent = user.select_agent(domain="Medical Affairs", role="MSL Expert")
response = agent.query(question=user_question)
```

### Mode 2: Automatic Selection
**AI recommends best 1-2 agents**

```python
# Analyze user question
question_analysis = analyze_question(user_question)
# domain, complexity, urgency, required_expertise

# Score all agents
agent_scores = []
for agent in all_agents:
    score = calculate_fit_score(
        question_analysis,
        agent.expertise_areas,
        agent.capabilities,
        agent.domain
    )
    agent_scores.append((agent, score))

# Select top 1-2 agents
best_agents = sorted(agent_scores, reverse=True)[:2]
responses = [agent.query(user_question) for agent, score in best_agents]
```

### Mode 3: Panel Auto-Assembly
**AI assembles optimal panel of 3-7 agents**

```python
# Analyze question to identify needed expertise
required_expertise = extract_expertise_needs(user_question)
# e.g., ['clinical development', 'regulatory strategy', 'medical affairs']

# Select diverse panel
panel_agents = []
for expertise in required_expertise:
    best_agent = find_best_agent_for_expertise(expertise, exclude=panel_agents)
    panel_agents.append(best_agent)

# Execute panel workflow
panel_results = execute_panel_workflow(
    panel_agents,
    user_question,
    panel_type="structured"  # or 'open', 'socratic', etc.
)
```
