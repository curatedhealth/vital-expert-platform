# Agent Reclassification Report

**Generated:** 2025-11-17
**Total Agents Reclassified:** 319
**Average Confidence:** 0.86

## Executive Summary

### Previous Classification (INCORRECT)
- ❌ ALL 319 agents classified as "Tier 2 EXPERT Agents"
- This is fundamentally flawed as it treats simple calculators the same as strategic domain experts

### New Classification (CORRECT)
Based on VITAL Enhanced Agent System specification:

| Tier | Count | Percentage | Description |
|------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **MASTER** | 1 | 0.3% | Top-level orchestrators |
| **EXPERT** | 239 | 74.9% | Domain experts |
| **SPECIALIST** | 75 | 23.5% | Focused specialists |
| **WORKER** | 4 | 1.3% | Task executors |
| **TOOL** | 0 | 0.0% | Simple utilities |

### Classification Confidence
- 🟢 **High (≥0.8):** 319 agents (100.0%)
- 🟡 **Medium (0.6-0.8):** 0 agents (0.0%)
- 🔴 **Low (<0.6):** 0 agents (0.0%)

## Impact Analysis

### Performance Optimization
Proper classification enables:
1. **Cost Optimization:** Use TOOL agents for simple tasks (100x cheaper than EXPERT)
2. **Speed Optimization:** Route simple queries to WORKER/TOOL (10x faster)
3. **Quality Optimization:** Reserve EXPERT/MASTER for complex decisions

### Example Cost Savings
- Simple dosing calculation: TOOL agent (~$0.001) vs EXPERT agent (~$0.10) = 100x savings
- Document generation: WORKER agent (~$0.01) vs EXPERT agent (~$0.10) = 10x savings
- Strategic planning: MASTER agent (appropriate) vs 5 separate EXPERT agents = better quality

## MASTER Agents (Tier 1) - 1 agents

**Purpose:** Top-level orchestrators coordinating multiple agents in complex workflows


### 🟢 Workflow Orchestration Agent
- **Confidence:** 0.95
- **Category:** operational
- **Reasoning:** The Workflow Orchestration Agent serves as a master orchestrator that coordinates multi-agent workflows, making it a top-level orchestrator. It manages task dependencies and handles error recovery, which aligns with the responsibilities of a MASTER tier agent that oversees complex workflows and strategic planning.
- **Key Indicators:** orchestration, workflow, coordination

## EXPERT Agents (Tier 2) - 239 agents

**Purpose:** Deep domain expertise requiring complex reasoning and strategic judgment

## WORKER Agents (Tier 4) - 4 agents

**Purpose:** Operational task executors following established procedures

<details>
<summary>Click to expand 4 WORKER agents</summary>

- 🟢 **Hub Services Manager** (0.85) - The Hub Services Manager primarily focuses on managing operational tasks related to patient support services, such as vendor management and service optimization. While they ensure a good patient experience, their role does not involve high-level strategic decision-making or coordination of multiple agents, which aligns more closely with a worker tier.
- 🟢 **Medical Affairs Operations Manager** (0.85) - The Medical Affairs Operations Manager primarily focuses on operational tasks such as budget management, process optimization, and resource coordination. While they play a crucial role in ensuring efficient operations, their responsibilities do not involve high-level strategic decision-making or complex orchestration of multiple agents, which are characteristics of higher tiers.
- 🟢 **Brand Manager** (0.85) - The Brand Manager primarily executes operational tasks related to marketing plans and brand performance without making high-level strategic decisions or coordinating multiple agents. Their role focuses on day-to-day management and optimization of promotional activities, which aligns with the characteristics of a task executor.
- 🟢 **Project Coordination Agent** (0.85) - The Project Coordination Agent primarily focuses on operational tasks such as managing project activities, stakeholder communications, and tracking deliverables. While it plays a crucial role in project execution, it does not engage in high-level strategic decision-making or complex workflows that would classify it as a higher tier.

## TOOL Agents (Tier 5) - 0 agents

**Purpose:** Simple utilities for calculations, lookups, and transformations


---

## Next Steps

### 1. Review Low-Confidence Classifications
Manually review agents with confidence < 0.6 to ensure correct classification.

### 2. Run Reclassification Migration
```bash
python3 scripts/run_migration.py --migration 006_reclassify_agents
```

### 3. Update Agent Metadata
Ensure agent metadata reflects new tier levels in database.

### 4. Update Routing Logic
Modify agent selection logic to:
- Route simple queries to TOOL/WORKER agents
- Route complex analyses to EXPERT agents
- Use MASTER agents for multi-step orchestration

### 5. Implement Deep Agent Architecture
For EXPERT and MASTER agents, implement Deep Agent capabilities:
- Chain of Thought reasoning
- Self-Critique mechanism
- Tree of Thoughts
- Supervisor-Worker pattern

---

## Validation

To validate this reclassification:
1. ✅ MASTER agents should coordinate multiple agents
2. ✅ EXPERT agents should require deep domain knowledge
3. ✅ SPECIALIST agents should have narrow, focused scope
4. ✅ WORKER agents should execute operational tasks
5. ✅ TOOL agents should be simple utilities without complex reasoning
