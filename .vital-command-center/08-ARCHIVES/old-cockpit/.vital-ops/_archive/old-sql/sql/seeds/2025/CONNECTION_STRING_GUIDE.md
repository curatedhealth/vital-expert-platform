You'll see multiple tabs:

Click the **"Copy"** button next to the connection string.

It will look like this:

**IMPORTANT**: The password is already included in this string (after the `:` and before the `@`)

### Step 5: Paste it into the Terminal
Go back to your terminal where the script is waiting and paste the entire string.

## 🚀 EASIEST METHOD: Skip Connection Issues Entirely

### Use Supabase SQL Editor (No Connection String Needed!)

This method bypasses all connection issues:

1. **Open**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xazinxsiglqokwfmogyk/sql/new
2. **Open** the file `UC_RA_001.sql` in your code editor
3. **Copy all** content (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
4. **Paste** into the SQL Editor
5. **Click "Run"** button (or press Cmd+Enter)
6. **Repeat** for all 10 files

**This method:**

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Use the SQL Editor method** - it's honestly faster and more reliable than dealing with connection strings! 

Just open each SQL file, copy the content, and run it in the Supabase SQL Editor. You'll be done in 5 minutes! 🚀

Would you like me to:
1. Help you construct the connection string if you have the password?
2. Create a quick automation script for the SQL Editor method?
3. Something else?
