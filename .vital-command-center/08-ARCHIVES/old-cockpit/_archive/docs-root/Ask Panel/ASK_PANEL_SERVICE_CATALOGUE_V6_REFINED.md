## 1. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

### 1.1 What is ASK PANEL™?

ASK PANEL™ is a **modular, AI-augmented virtual advisory board platform** that orchestrates structured multi-expert decision-making for complex, high-stakes business contexts. It combines **LangGraph workflow orchestration** with **LangChain multi-agent reasoning** to replicate how real advisory boards deliberate, challenge, and converge.

### 1.2 Service Architecture Philosophy

Our service catalogue is built on a **4-dimensional MECE framework**:

## 2. SERVICE ARCHITECTURE: FOUR CORE DIMENSIONS

### 2.1 Why Four Dimensions?

Each dimension addresses a critical service design question:

1. **DIMENSION 1 (Flow Type)**: *How should the panel reason?*
2. **DIMENSION 2 (Intervention Mode)**: *Who should participate and how?*
3. **DIMENSION 3 (Panel Format)**: *What deliberation structure should we use?*
4. **DIMENSION 4 (Business Context)**: *What problem are we solving?*

These dimensions are **orthogonal** (independent) and **collectively exhaustive** (cover all scenarios).

### 3.2 Flow Type Detailed Specifications

#### 3.2.1 STRUCTURED FLOW

**Definition**: Sequential, systematic verification of facts, requirements, or compliance criteria

**Characteristics:**
- Linear progression (must complete each step)
- Binary evaluation (pass/fail, yes/no)
- Evidence-based validation
- Mandatory audit trail
- Minimal subjectivity

**Reasoning Logic:**
```
FOR each criterion in checklist:
  IF evidence exists AND meets standard:
    MARK as PASS
  ELSE:
    MARK as FAIL, document gap
  MOVE to next criterion
GENERATE compliance report
```

**When to Use:**
- Regulatory compliance verification
- SOP validation and approval
- Quality system audits
- Checklist-based assessments
- Gap analysis

**When NOT to Use:**
- Need creative solutions (use EXPLORATORY)
- Multiple valid options exist (use ANALYTICAL)
- Subjective judgment required
- Stakeholder alignment needed (use CONSENSUS)

**Business Examples:**
- FDA 510(k) checklist validation
- ISO 13485 compliance review
- MDR technical documentation assessment
- 21 CFR Part 11 software validation
- CAPA effectiveness verification

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Most objective (evidence-driven)
- ✅ Highest audit defensibility
- ✅ Fastest for binary decisions
- ❌ Least flexible (rigid structure)
- ❌ Not suitable for ambiguous situations

---

#### 3.2.2 ANALYTICAL FLOW

**Definition**: Systematic comparison of multiple alternatives using weighted, quantitative criteria

**Characteristics:**
- Multi-criteria evaluation
- Weighted scoring methodology
- Sensitivity analysis
- Rank-ordering outputs
- Quantitative + qualitative balance

**Reasoning Logic:**
```
DEFINE alternatives [A, B, C]
DEFINE criteria [C1, C2, ..., Cn]
ASSIGN weights [W1, W2, ..., Wn] where ΣW = 100%

FOR each alternative:
  FOR each criterion:
    SCORE on scale (e.g., 0-10)
  CALCULATE weighted total = Σ(Score × Weight)
  
RANK alternatives by weighted total
PERFORM sensitivity analysis (vary weights ±20%)
IDENTIFY robust vs. fragile rankings
```

**When to Use:**
- Portfolio prioritization
- Vendor/partner selection
- Strategic option comparison
- Resource allocation decisions
- HTA (Health Technology Assessment)

**When NOT to Use:**
- Only one option exists
- Criteria cannot be quantified
- Pure exploration needed (use EXPLORATORY)
- Binary pass/fail needed (use STRUCTURED)

**Business Examples:**
- Indication prioritization (Pharma)
- Digital health feature prioritization
- Medical device vendor selection
- Market entry sequence decisions
- R&D portfolio balancing

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Transparent decision rationale
- ✅ Quantitative defensibility
- ✅ Handles complexity well
- ⚠️ Requires clear criteria definition
- ❌ Can oversimplify qualitative factors

---

#### 3.2.3 EXPLORATORY FLOW

**Definition**: Open-ended ideation and hypothesis generation without constraint

**Characteristics:**
- Divergent thinking encouraged
- No premature evaluation
- Quantity over quality (initially)
- Cross-pollination of ideas
- Emergence of unexpected insights

**Reasoning Logic:**
```
PHASE 1: Silent/parallel ideation (no critique)
  GENERATE maximum ideas without filtering
  
PHASE 2: Clustering and categorization
  GROUP similar ideas
  IDENTIFY themes
  
PHASE 3: Elaboration (optional)
  SELECT promising ideas
  DEVELOP concepts further
  
PHASE 4: Prioritization (if needed)
  RANK by feasibility, impact, novelty
```

**When to Use:**
- Innovation workshops
- Unmet needs discovery
- Problem reframing
- Early-stage strategy development
- Brainstorming sessions

**When NOT to Use:**
- Need immediate decision
- Clear options already exist (use ANALYTICAL)
- Compliance verification (use STRUCTURED)
- High-stakes with limited time

**Business Examples:**
- New product/service ideation
- Patient engagement innovations
- Clinical trial design alternatives
- Digital health feature discovery
- Business model innovation

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Maximizes creativity
- ✅ Discovers non-obvious solutions
- ✅ Low risk of premature convergence
- ❌ Doesn't produce immediate decisions
- ❌ Can generate too many options

---

#### 3.2.4 ADVERSARIAL FLOW

**Definition**: Structured challenge and stress-testing of proposals, assumptions, or strategies

**Characteristics:**
- Attack/defense structure
- Devil's advocate reasoning
- Bias and blind-spot detection
- Pre-mortem thinking
- Constructive criticism

**Reasoning Logic:**
```
PRESENT proposal/strategy

ATTACK PHASE:
  GENERATE failure scenarios
  CHALLENGE evidence quality
  IDENTIFY hidden assumptions
  QUESTION feasibility
  
DEFENSE PHASE:
  COUNTER-ARGUE each challenge
  PROVIDE additional evidence
  PROPOSE mitigations
  ACKNOWLEDGE valid risks
  
SYNTHESIS:
  ASSESS residual risks
  STRENGTHEN proposal
  DOCUMENT risk ledger
```

**When to Use:**
- Pre-launch risk reviews
- Investment due diligence
- Strategic plan validation
- High-stakes decisions
- Before irreversible commitments

**When NOT to Use:**
- Team morale is fragile
- Already consensus-driven culture
- Purely exploratory phase
- Low-stakes, reversible decisions

**Business Examples:**
- Product launch readiness (Murder Board)
- Clinical trial protocol review
- M&A due diligence
- Major capital investment review
- Regulatory strategy validation

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Exposes blind spots
- ✅ Strengthens weak proposals
- ✅ Reduces overconfidence
- ⚠️ Requires psychological safety
- ❌ Can be demoralizing if not framed well

---

#### 3.2.5 CONSENSUS FLOW

**Definition**: Iterative convergence of distributed expert opinions toward shared understanding

**Characteristics:**
- Anonymous input (reduces bias)
- Statistical feedback
- Multiple rounds
- Convergence tracking
- Minority opinion preservation

**Reasoning Logic:**
```
ROUND 1: Initial independent estimates/opinions
  COLLECT without discussion
  AGGREGATE statistically (median, IQR)
  
ROUND 2: Feedback and revision
  SHARE aggregate statistics (anonymous)
  SHARE outlier rationales (anonymous)
  ALLOW revision of estimates
  MEASURE convergence (IQR narrowing)
  
ROUND 3+: Continue until convergence
  REPEAT feedback-revision cycle
  STOP when IQR < threshold OR rounds = max
  
FINAL: Synthesize consensus + document dissent
```

**When to Use:**
- Forecasting and prediction
- Expert elicitation
- Uncertain parameter estimation
- Cross-functional alignment
- When groupthink is a risk

**When NOT to Use:**
- Immediate decision needed (use CRISIS)
- Objective data available (use ANALYTICAL)
- Single expert sufficient
- Binary compliance check (use STRUCTURED)

**Business Examples:**
- Market adoption forecasting (Delphi)
- Regulatory approval timeline estimates
- Clinical endpoint value assessment
- Technology maturity predictions
- Competitive landscape analysis

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Reduces bias and dominance
- ✅ Quantifies uncertainty
- ✅ Captures collective wisdom
- ⚠️ Requires multiple rounds (slower)
- ❌ May not converge if truly divergent

---

#### 3.2.6 SIMULATIVE FLOW

**Definition**: Role-playing and scenario enactment to anticipate stakeholder reactions

**Characteristics:**
- Perspective-taking
- Multi-stakeholder representation
- Realistic dialogue
- Negotiation dynamics
- Low-cost experimentation

**Reasoning Logic:**
```
DEFINE scenario and stakeholders

ASSIGN roles:
  PayerAgent, RegulatorAgent, ClinicianAgent, PatientAgent, etc.
  
CALIBRATE agents:
  Historical positions
  Typical concerns
  Budget/resource constraints
  
SIMULATE interaction:
  ROUND 1: Opening positions
  ROUND 2: Evidence exchange
  ROUND 3: Negotiation
  ROUND 4: Attempted resolution
  
ANALYZE outcomes:
  Points of agreement
  Persistent conflicts
  Successful arguments
  Failed approaches
```

**When to Use:**
- Payer negotiation preparation
- Regulatory strategy testing
- Policy impact assessment
- Stakeholder engagement planning
- Contract negotiation prep

**When NOT to Use:**
- Single stakeholder decision
- No negotiation/interaction needed
- Pure technical assessment
- When simulation fidelity is insufficient

**Business Examples:**
- Value-based contract simulation
- FDA Pre-Sub meeting preparation
- HTA dossier defense practice
- Partnership term negotiation
- Policy advocacy planning

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Low-risk experimentation
- ✅ Reveals hidden objections
- ✅ Tests multiple strategies
- ⚠️ Simulation accuracy varies
- ❌ Doesn't replace real negotiations

---

#### 3.2.7 CRISIS FLOW

**Definition**: Time-bound, SLA-driven rapid decision-making under uncertainty and pressure

**Characteristics:**
- Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints
- Triage prioritization
- Parallel processing
- Incomplete information tolerance
- Action-oriented (bias toward decision)

**Reasoning Logic:**
```
DETECT signal/event

CLASSIFY urgency:
  Critical: 2-hour SLA
  High: 8-hour SLA  
  Medium: 24-hour SLA
  Low: 48-hour SLA
  
ASSEMBLE experts (auto-convene)

PARALLEL ANALYSIS:
  Impact assessment
  Root cause hypotheses
  Mitigation options
  
RAPID DECISION (within SLA):
  Select mitigation
  Assign owners
  Set checkpoints
  
EXECUTE and MONITOR
```

**When to Use:**
- Safety signal response
- Supply chain disruption
- Cybersecurity incidents
- Manufacturing deviations
- Regulatory enforcement actions

**When NOT to Use:**
- Sufficient time for thorough analysis
- Decision is reversible/low-stakes
- Learning opportunity (use slower flow)
- When hasty decision increases risk

**Business Examples:**
- Pharmacovigilance CAPA
- Product recall coordination
- Ransomware response
- FDA Warning Letter response
- Contamination incident

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Fastest decision speed
- ✅ SLA-guaranteed response
- ✅ Action-bias appropriate for emergencies
- ⚠️ Accepts incomplete information
- ❌ May make suboptimal decisions vs. more time
