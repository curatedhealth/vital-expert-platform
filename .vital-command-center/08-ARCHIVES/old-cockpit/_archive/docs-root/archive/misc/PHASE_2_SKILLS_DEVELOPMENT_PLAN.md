## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 3-4: Critical Infrastructure Skills

Develop the top 5 highest-demand missing skills:
1. `data_analysis` (71 agents)
2. `regulatory_database_search` (45 agents)
3. `drug_interaction_analysis` (41 agents)
4. `dosing_calculation` (35 agents)
5. `generate_submission_template` (33 agents)

### Week 5-6: High Priority Domain Skills

Develop next 10 high-priority skills focusing on regulatory and clinical domains.

### Week 7-8: Medium Priority Skills

Develop medium-priority skills for specialized capabilities.

### Week 9-10: Integration & Testing

- Link skills to capabilities via `capability_skills` table
- Link agents to skills via `agent_skills` table
- Test agent performance with new skills
- Validate gold standard compliance

### Week 11+: Low Priority & Maintenance

- Develop low-priority skills as needed
- Monitor skill usage patterns
- Refine existing skills based on feedback

---

## Skill Development Guidelines

For each missing skill to develop:

1. **Research:** Understand what the skill needs to do (review agents using it)
2. **Design:** Create skill specification (inputs, outputs, behavior)
3. **Implement:** Write skill in `.claude/skills/` directory
4. **Test:** Validate with agents that require it
5. **Document:** Add to skills table via migration
6. **Link:** Create `capability_skills` records for capabilities it enables

---

## Success Metrics

Phase 2 is successful when:

- ✅ All high-priority skills developed and tested
- ✅ 80%+ of medium-priority skills developed
- ✅ Skills properly linked to capabilities
- ✅ Agents can access required skills via capability mapping
- ✅ Gold standard agents validated with full skill support

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this plan with stakeholders
2. Prioritize which high-priority skills to develop first
3. Assign development resources
4. Begin skill development in `.claude/skills/`
5. Update migrations to add new skills to `skills` table
