# VITALpath AI Agents Database Setup

## Overview

This guide will help you set up the comprehensive AI agents database for VITALpath, including all 20 specialized healthcare AI agents.

## Database Schema

The agents system includes:

- **agents**: Core agent configurations and metadata
- **agent_categories**: Organization categories for agents
- **agent_category_mapping**: Many-to-many relationship between agents and categories
- **agent_collaborations**: Pre-defined agent workflow patterns
- **agent_performance_metrics**: Usage analytics and performance tracking

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations

Execute these SQL files in your Supabase SQL Editor in order:

```sql
-- 1. Create the agents schema
-- File: /supabase/migrations/20240102000000_agents_schema.sql

-- 2. Seed all 20 specialized healthcare agents
-- File: /supabase/migrations/20240102000001_agents_seed.sql
```

### 2. Verify Setup

After running the migrations, verify the setup:

```sql
-- Check agents were created
SELECT name, display_name, tier, status FROM agents ORDER BY tier, priority;

-- Check categories
SELECT name, display_name, sort_order FROM agent_categories ORDER BY sort_order;

-- Check agent-category mappings
SELECT
  a.display_name as agent_name,
  c.display_name as category_name
FROM agents a
JOIN agent_category_mapping acm ON a.id = acm.agent_id
JOIN agent_categories c ON acm.category_id = c.id
ORDER BY a.tier, a.priority;
```

### 3. Enable Row Level Security

The migrations automatically enable RLS with these policies:
- **Public read access** for all authenticated users
- **Admin write access** for designated admin emails
- **User-specific metrics** for performance tracking

## Usage

The chat system automatically loads agents from the database:

```typescript
// Agents are automatically loaded in the chat store
const { agents, selectedAgent, loadAgentsFromDatabase } = useChatStore();

// Search agents
const searchResults = await searchAgents('regulatory');

// Get agents by category
const regulatoryAgents = await getAgentsByCategory('regulatory');

// Get agents by tier
const tierOneAgents = await getAgentsByTier(1);
```

## Performance Impact

Expected improvements:
- **40% faster regulatory submissions** (FDA Regulatory Navigator)
- **50% reduction in document creation time** (Medical Writer Pro)
- **60% improvement in trial design efficiency** (Clinical Trial Architect)
