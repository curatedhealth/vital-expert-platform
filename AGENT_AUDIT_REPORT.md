   - Tier-3 = Ultra-Specialist tier should have premium models only
   - Cost optimization opportunity: ~$20K/month potential savings

3. **Inactive Agent Majority**
   - 249 agents (88%) are inactive
   - Need activation criteria and phased rollout plan
   - Opportunity: Validate before activating to ensure quality

## 📈 Tier Distribution Analysis

### Tier 3: Ultra-Specialist (96 agents, 11 active)

**Target Profile:**
- Model: GPT-4 or Claude-3-Opus
- Temperature: 0.2
- Max tokens: 4000
- Context window: 16000
- Cost: $0.20-0.50/query
- Accuracy: >95%

**Current State:**
| Model | Total | Active | Has Evidence | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|---------|
| gpt-4o-mini | 85 | 0 | 0 | 🔴 **WRONG MODEL** |
| gpt-4 | 8 | 8 | 2 | 🟡 Need evidence (6 missing) |
| claude-3-opus-20240229 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 🟡 Need evidence |
| claude-3-opus | 1 | 1 | 1 | ✅ Complete |

**Critical Issues:**
- ⚠️ **85 agents** using low-cost model (gpt-4o-mini) in ultra-specialist tier
- ⚠️ Should be using GPT-4 ($0.35/query) or Claude-3-Opus ($0.40/query)
- ⚠️ All 85 are inactive - opportunity to fix before activation

**Action Required:**
1. Audit all 85 gpt-4o-mini agents - should they be Tier-3?
2. If yes: Upgrade to GPT-4 with evidence
3. If no: Downgrade to Tier-2 or Tier-1
4. Add model_justification + model_citation for all 10 active agents

---

### Tier 2: Specialist (175 agents, 11 active)

**Target Profile:**
- Model: GPT-4, GPT-4-Turbo, or BioGPT
- Temperature: 0.4
- Max tokens: 3000
- Context window: 8000
- Cost: $0.05-0.15/query
- Accuracy: 90-95%

**Current State:**
| Model | Total | Active | Has Evidence | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|---------|
| gpt-4 | 173 | 9 | 3 | 🟡 Need evidence (170 missing) |
| microsoft/biogpt | 1 | 1 | 1 | ✅ Complete |
| BioGPT | 1 | 1 | 0 | 🟡 Need evidence |

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ **173 agents** using GPT-4 without evidence/justification
- ⚠️ Only 1 agent using cost-effective BioGPT
- ⚠️ Potential cost optimization: BioGPT for biomedical tasks

**Action Required:**
1. For all 173 GPT-4 agents: Add model_justification + citation
2. Evaluate which agents could use BioGPT (5x cheaper, biomedical-specific)
3. For active agents (9): Immediate evidence addition
4. For inactive (164): Add evidence before activation

- Temperature: 0.6
- Max tokens: 2000
- Context window: 4000
- Cost: $0.01-0.03/query
- Accuracy: 85-90%

**Current State:**
| Model | Total | Active | Has Evidence | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|---------|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | 8 | 8 | 7 | ✅ Best performance! |
| gpt-4 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 🔴 Wrong model (over-spec'd) |

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ **4 agents** using expensive GPT-4 in foundational tier
- ⚠️ Should use GPT-3.5-Turbo (15x cheaper)
- ✅ **7 out of 8** GPT-3.5-Turbo agents have complete evidence (58% completion rate!)

**Action Required:**
1. Downgrade 4 GPT-4 agents to GPT-3.5-Turbo
2. Add evidence for the 1 missing GPT-3.5-Turbo agent
3. Use this tier as the template for evidence standards (highest compliance!)

**Future Optimization (Activate Tier-3 agents correctly):**
- If 85 gpt-4o-mini agents were activated as-is: $0.05/query × 85 = $4.25/query
- If upgraded to GPT-4 properly: $0.35/query × 85 = $29.75/query
- **Difference: $25.50/query**
- **Critical Decision:** Are these really Tier-3 agents?

**BioGPT Opportunity (Tier-2 biomedical agents):**
- GPT-4: $0.12/query
- BioGPT: $0.08/query (33% cheaper, biomedical-specialized)
- For biomedical/pharmaceutical agents, BioGPT is optimal

**Monthly Cost Projections (Assuming 10K queries/month):**
- Current (34 agents): $5.84 × 10,000 = **$58,400/month**
- After Tier-1 optimization: $5.42 × 10,000 = **$54,200/month** (7% reduction)
- If all 283 activated (current models): **~$450,000/month**
- If all 283 optimized properly: **~$280,000/month** (38% reduction)

## 📋 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (Week 1) - SAFETY CRITICAL

**Fix Active Tier-3 Agents with Wrong Models (Priority: CRITICAL)**

Target: 85 inactive Tier-3 agents using gpt-4o-mini

**Decision Tree:**
```
For each agent:
1. Is this truly ultra-specialist (>95% accuracy required)?
   YES → Upgrade to GPT-4 ($0.35/query) + add evidence
   NO → Consider moving to Tier-2

2. Is this a safety-critical agent (dosing, interactions, clinical decisions)?
   YES → MUST use GPT-4, cannot compromise
   NO → Evaluate tier appropriateness

3. Is this a biomedical/pharmaceutical specialist?
   YES → Consider BioGPT for Tier-2 (cheaper, specialized)
   NO → Use standard tier models
```

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ **Dosing Calculator** → Activate with GPT-4 (safety critical)
2. ✅ **Drug Interaction Checker** → Activate with GPT-4 (safety critical)
3. ✅ **Pediatric Dosing Specialist** → Activate with GPT-4 (safety critical)
4. ✅ **Adverse Event Reporter** → Activate with GPT-4 (FDA compliance)
5. ✅ **Pharmacokinetics Advisor** → Activate with GPT-4 (calculations)

### Phase 2: Evidence Addition (Weeks 2-3)

**Add Model Justification + Citation to All Active Agents**

Target: 20 active agents without evidence

Template:
```javascript
{
  model: "gpt-4",
  model_justification: "High-accuracy [domain] specialist for [specific use case]. GPT-4 achieves 86.7% on MedQA (USMLE), 86.4% on MMLU, ensuring [outcome].",
  model_citation: "OpenAI (2023). GPT-4 Technical Report. arXiv:2303.08774"
}
```

**Batch Processing:**
- Week 2: Add evidence to 8 Tier-3 active agents
- Week 3: Add evidence to 8 Tier-2 active agents
- Week 3: Fix 4 Tier-1 agents (wrong model)

### Phase 3: Tier Realignment (Weeks 4-6)

**Review All 85 Tier-3 gpt-4o-mini Agents**

Process:
1. Group by specialty (clinical, regulatory, operations, etc.)
2. Expert review: Is Tier-3 (>95% accuracy) truly required?
3. Decision outcomes:
   - Keep Tier-3 → Upgrade to GPT-4 + add evidence
   - Move to Tier-2 → Keep gpt-4o-mini OR upgrade to GPT-4-Turbo + add evidence
   - Move to Tier-1 → Downgrade to gpt-3.5-turbo + add evidence

### Phase 4: Systematic Evidence Addition (Weeks 7-12)

**Add Evidence to All 269 Remaining Agents**

Batch by tier:
- Tier 3: 90 agents remaining (after Phase 3 realignment)
- Tier 2: 164+ agents
- Tier 1: 10 agents

Use automation:
- Template-based generation
- Expert review sampling (20%)
- Validation against benchmarks
