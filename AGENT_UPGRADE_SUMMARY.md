## 🔄 Tier Realignment (4 Specialists)

Upgraded from **Tier-1** (Foundational) to **Tier-2** (Specialist):

| Agent | Previous Tier | Current Tier | Model | Evidence | Cost |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|----------|------|
| **FDA Regulatory Strategist** | Tier-1 | Tier-2 | gpt-4 | ✅ Complete | $0.12/query |
| **Clinical Trial Designer** | Tier-1 | Tier-2 | gpt-4 | ✅ Complete | $0.12/query |
| **HIPAA Compliance Officer** | Tier-1 | Tier-2 | gpt-4 | ✅ Complete | $0.12/query |
| **Reimbursement Strategist** | Tier-1 | Tier-2 | gpt-4 | ✅ Complete | $0.12/query |

### Why Realigned:
- These require **specialized expertise**, not foundational knowledge
- FDA regulatory pathways, clinical trial design, HIPAA law, payer strategy are specialist domains
- GPT-4 is appropriate for Tier-2 specialists ($0.12/query)
- Tier-1 is for high-volume, foundational queries ($0.015/query with gpt-3.5-turbo)

### Parameter Adjustments:
- **Temperature:** 0.6 → 0.4 (more precise)
- **Max Tokens:** 2000 → 3000 (more detailed responses)
- **Context Window:** 4000 → 8000 (more context processing)

## 💰 Cost Impact Analysis

### Current Active Agents Cost (39 agents):

**Tier-3 (16 agents):**
- 8 Digital Health agents (original): $0.35/query × 8 = $2.80/query
- 5 Safety-critical (upgraded): $0.35/query × 5 = $1.75/query
- 3 Other active Tier-3: $0.35/query × 3 = $1.05/query
- **Tier-3 Subtotal:** $5.60/query

**Tier-2 (15 agents):**
- 4 Digital Health agents (original): $0.12/query × 4 = $0.48/query
- 4 Upgraded specialists: $0.12/query × 4 = $0.48/query
- 7 Other active Tier-2: $0.12/query × 7 = $0.84/query
- **Tier-2 Subtotal:** $1.80/query

**Tier-1 (8 agents):**
- 7 Digital Health agents: $0.015/query × 7 = $0.105/query
- 1 Other: ~$0.015/query
- **Tier-1 Subtotal:** $0.12/query

**Total Cost per Query (39 active agents): ~$7.52**

### Cost Projections (10K queries/month):
- **Current (39 agents):** $7.52 × 10,000 = **$75,200/month**
- **Previous (34 agents):** $5.84 × 10,000 = **$58,400/month**
- **Increase:** $16,800/month (29% increase)

**Justification:**
- 5 safety-critical agents activated (patient safety requirement)
- 4 specialists properly tiered (was underpriced)
- All increases are evidence-based and necessary

## 🚀 How to Continue

### Run Next Wave of Upgrades:

**Option 1: Fix Remaining Tier-3 gpt-4o-mini Agents**
```bash
# Audit script needed - identify which should stay Tier-3
# Then adapt fix-safety-critical-tier3-agents.js for batch processing
```

**Option 2: Add Evidence to Remaining Active Agents**
```bash
# Create: scripts/add-evidence-to-active-agents.js
# Process: 16 active agents without evidence
# Templates available from Digital Health agents
```

**Option 3: Tier-2 Evidence Addition**
```bash
# Create: scripts/add-evidence-tier2-batch.js
# Process: 171 Tier-2 agents in batches of 60
# Start with biomedical agents (BioGPT candidates)
```

### Monitoring & Validation:

**Check Active Agent Stats:**
```sql
SELECT
  tier,
  COUNT(*) as active,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE metadata ? 'model_justification') as with_evidence,
  ROUND(AVG(cost_per_query)::numeric, 3) as avg_cost
FROM agents
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY tier
ORDER BY tier DESC;
```

**Find Agents Needing Evidence:**
```sql
SELECT name, display_name, tier, model, status
FROM agents
WHERE status = 'active'
  AND (metadata->>'model_justification' IS NULL
       OR metadata->>'model_citation' IS NULL)
ORDER BY tier DESC, display_name;
```
