  Concurrent Users: 100-500
  API Calls/Day: 10,000-50,000
  Response Time: 5-15 seconds
  Database Connections: 100 (Supabase limit)
  Memory Usage: Single instance (estimated 1-2GB)

Target Requirements:
  Concurrent Users: 10,000 (20-100x increase)
  API Calls/Day: 1,000,000 (20-100x increase)
  Response Time: <2 seconds (75% improvement)
  Uptime: 99.95%
  Global Distribution: Multi-region support
```

#### Scalability Bottlenecks
