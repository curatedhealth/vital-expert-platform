- Modify system settings and user permissions
- Trigger sensitive operations (backups, exports)

**4. Data Exfiltration**
- Export sensitive data via unprotected endpoints
- Access audit logs and security events
- Download organization data

### Compliance Impact

**HIPAA Violations:**
- PHI accessible without proper authentication

## Immediate Action Required

### P0 Critical Fixes (Within 24 Hours)

**1. Protect All Admin API Routes**
```typescript
// Add to ALL 47+ admin routes:
import { withAuth } from '@/lib/auth/api-auth-middleware';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return withAuth(request, async (req, user) => {
    if (!['admin', 'super_admin'].includes(user.role)) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
    }
    // Existing code here...
  });
}
```

**2. Replace Service Role Key Usage**
```typescript
// Replace in ALL 54 API routes:
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
// Instead of:
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);
```

**3. Implement Organization Data Isolation**
```sql
-- Add to ALL sensitive tables:
ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "organization_isolation" ON table_name
  FOR ALL USING (
    organization_id = get_user_organization_id() OR
    is_organization_admin()
  );
```
