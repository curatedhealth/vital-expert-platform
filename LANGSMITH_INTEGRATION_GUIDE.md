## 🎓 Advanced Features

### 1. **Tagging Traces**

Add tags to organize traces:

```typescript
// File: /src/lib/services/langgraph-orchestrator.ts

async orchestrate(params: {...}): Promise<any> {
  // Add tags to execution config
  const result = await app.invoke(
    inputState,
    {
      configurable: { thread_id: sessionId },
      tags: [
        `mode:${params.mode}`,
        `experts:${params.personas.length}`,
        `domain:${params.domain || 'general'}`
      ]
    }
  );
  // ... rest
}
```

Then filter by tags in LangSmith!

### 2. **Custom Metadata**

Add custom metadata to traces:

```typescript
const result = await app.invoke(
  inputState,
  {
    configurable: { thread_id: sessionId },
    metadata: {
      user_id: req.userId,
      organization: req.org,
      consultation_type: 'strategic',
      priority: 'high'
    }
  }
);
```

### 3. **Feedback Collection**

Collect user feedback on traces:

```typescript
import { Client } from "langsmith";

const client = new Client();

// After user reviews the consultation
await client.createFeedback(traceId, "user_feedback", {
  score: 0.9,
  comment: "Excellent recommendations, very helpful",
  correction: null
});
```
