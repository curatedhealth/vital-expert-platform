## How It Works

### Data Flow: Supabase ‚Üí Frontend

```
1. Agents are stored in Supabase with:
   - business_function: "market_access"
   - department: "Health Economics & Outcomes Research (HEOR)"
   - role: "Health Economist"

2. API endpoint /api/agents-crud?action=get_org_structure
   queries all active agents and extracts unique:
   - Business Functions (6 total)
   - Departments (26 total)
   - Roles (46 total)

3. Frontend dropdowns populate dynamically from this data:
   - Select business function ‚Üí Shows relevant departments
   - Select department ‚Üí Shows relevant roles
```

### Frontend Usage

When creating or editing an agent in the frontend:

1. **Select Business Function**: "market_access"
2. **Department dropdown** will show all 12 Market Access departments
3. **Role dropdown** will show all 34 Market Access roles

The dropdowns are **dynamically populated** from actual agent data in Supabase.

## Verification

Run these scripts to verify:

```bash
# Check all Market Access agents
npx tsx scripts/verify-agent-org-data.ts

# Test API response
npx tsx scripts/test-api-response.ts

# View Market Access structure
npx tsx scripts/add-market-access-structure.ts
```

## API Endpoints

### Get All Agents
```
GET /api/agents-crud
```
Returns all 530 active agents with their function, department, and role.

### Get Organizational Structure
```
GET /api/agents-crud?action=get_org_structure
```
Returns:
- 6 business functions
- 26 unique departments
- 46 unique roles

## Database Structure

All data is stored in the `agents` table:

| Column | Type | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| business_function | string | "market_access" |
| department | string | "Health Economics & Outcomes Research (HEOR)" |
| role | string | "Health Economist" |

**No separate tables needed** - the agents table is the single source of truth!
