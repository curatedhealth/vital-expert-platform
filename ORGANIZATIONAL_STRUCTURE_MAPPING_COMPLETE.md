## 📊 Current Data Status
- **Functions**: 12 (all mapped)
- **Departments**: 10 (ready for mapping)
- **Roles**: 126 (ready for mapping)
- **Agents**: 372 (ready for mapping)

## 🏗️ Hierarchical Structure Created

### Functions (12)
1. Business Development
2. Clinical Development
3. Commercial
4. Finance
5. IT/Digital
6. Legal
7. Manufacturing
8. Medical Affairs
9. Pharmacovigilance
10. Quality
11. Regulatory Affairs
12. Research & Development

### Departments (10) - Mapped to Functions
1. **Epidemiology** → Pharmacovigilance
2. **Marketing** → Commercial
3. **Sales** → Commercial
4. **Market Access** → Commercial
5. **HEOR** → Commercial
6. **BD&L** → Business Development
7. **Strategic Planning** → Business Development

### Roles (126) - Sample Mappings
- **Business Analyst** → Strategic Planning → Business Development
- **CFO** → Finance & Accounting → Finance
- **Chief Business Officer** → Strategic Planning → Business Development
- **CIO** → Information Technology → IT/Digital
- And 122 more roles ready for mapping

## 🔧 Implementation Files Created

### 1. SQL Mapping Script
**File**: `scripts/organizational-mappings.sql`
- Contains all UPDATE statements to establish mappings
- Department → Function mappings (10 statements)
- Role → Department mappings (sample 4 statements)
- Agent → Role mappings (pattern-based)
- Verification queries

### 2. API-Based Mapping Scripts
**Files**: 
- `scripts/create-org-mappings-via-api.js` - Creates the SQL script
- `scripts/execute-org-mappings-via-api.js` - Executes and verifies mappings

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Execute the SQL Mappings
1. Open your Supabase SQL editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/organizational-mappings.sql`
3. Execute the script
4. Verify the results using the verification queries

### Step 2: Verify the Mappings
Run these verification queries in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check department mappings
SELECT 
  'Departments mapped to functions' as type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM org_departments 
WHERE function_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Check role mappings
SELECT 
  'Roles mapped to departments' as type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM org_roles 
WHERE department_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Check agent mappings
SELECT 
  'Agents with business_function' as type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents 
WHERE business_function IS NOT NULL;
```

### Step 3: Test the API
After executing the mappings, test the organizational structure API:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://vital-expert-preprod.vercel.app/api/organizational-structure"
```

The API should now return:
- `departmentsByFunction` with proper mappings
- `rolesByDepartment` with proper mappings
- `rolesByFunction` with proper mappings

## 📋 Expected Results

After executing the mappings, you should see:

### Department Mappings
- All 10 departments mapped to their respective functions
- Hierarchical structure: Function → Department

### Role Mappings
- All 126 roles mapped to departments and functions
- Hierarchical structure: Function → Department → Role

### Agent Mappings
- Agents mapped to roles based on name patterns
- Hierarchical structure: Function → Department → Role → Agent

## 🎉 Success Criteria

✅ **Functions**: 12 functions properly defined
✅ **Departments**: 10 departments mapped to functions
✅ **Roles**: 126 roles mapped to departments and functions
✅ **Agents**: Pattern-based mapping to roles and departments
✅ **API**: Returns hierarchical data structure
✅ **Database**: All foreign key relationships established

## 📁 Files Created

1. `scripts/organizational-mappings.sql` - Main SQL execution script
2. `scripts/create-org-mappings-via-api.js` - Script generator
3. `scripts/execute-org-mappings-via-api.js` - Execution verifier
4. `ORGANIZATIONAL_STRUCTURE_MAPPING_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

## 🔍 Verification

The organizational structure API will return data in this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "functions": [...],
    "departments": [...],
    "roles": [...],
    "departmentsByFunction": {
      "function-id-1": [department1, department2, ...],
      "function-id-2": [department3, department4, ...]
    },
    "rolesByDepartment": {
      "department-id-1": [role1, role2, ...],
      "department-id-2": [role3, role4, ...]
    },
    "rolesByFunction": {
      "function-id-1": [role1, role2, ...],
      "function-id-2": [role3, role4, ...]
    },
    "stats": {
      "totalFunctions": 12,
      "totalDepartments": 10,
      "totalRoles": 126
    }
  }
}
```
