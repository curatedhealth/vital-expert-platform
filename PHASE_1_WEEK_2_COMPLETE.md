## Cost Analysis

### Per-Query Cost Impact

**Before Transformation:**
- 80 Tier-3 agents × $0.05 (gpt-4o-mini) = $4.00/query
- 16 Tier-3 agents × $0.35 (gpt-4) = $5.60/query
- **Total Tier-3 cost: $9.60/query**

**After Transformation:**
- 25 Tier-3 agents × $0.35 (gpt-4) = $8.75/query
- 13 Tier-3 agents × $0.35 (gpt-4, existing) = $4.55/query
- 3 Tier-3 agents × $0.40 (claude-3-opus) = $1.20/query
- **Total Tier-3 cost: $14.50/query**
- 55 new Tier-2 agents × $0.12 (gpt-4) = $6.60/query
- **Total downgraded agents cost: $6.60/query**

**Net Change:**
- Tier-3 increase: +$4.90/query
- Tier-2 new cost: +$6.60/query
