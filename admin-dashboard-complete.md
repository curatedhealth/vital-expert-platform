- `compliance-reporting.service.ts` - Compliance report generation
- `llm-governance.service.ts` - Policy and change management
- `identity-hardening.service.ts` - SSO, MFA, access reviews
- `immutable-audit.service.ts` - Audit storage and SIEM export

### UI Components
Each feature has a dedicated page with tabbed interfaces for different aspects:

## Summary

All three phases of the admin dashboard have been successfully implemented, providing:

1. **Phase 1 - Foundations**: Complete admin route guards, audit log viewer, user/role management, and API key management
2. **Phase 2 - Compliance & Operations**: Tenant management, health monitoring with SLO tracking, compliance reporting (HIPAA/SOC2/FDA), and incident response playbooks
3. **Phase 3 - Governance & Enterprise**: LLM governance with policy-as-code, identity hardening with SSO/MFA, and immutable audit storage with SIEM export

**Recent Updates**: Several components have been simplified to improve usability while maintaining core functionality. The simplified interfaces focus on essential features and provide a cleaner, more intuitive user experience.

The implementation maintains the highest standards for security, compliance, audit logging, and user experience throughout all phases, with comprehensive error handling and responsive design.
