# Admin Phase 2 (Compliance & Operations) - ✅ COMPLETED

## Scope

Implement Phase 2 features from the Admin Dashboard Assessment:

1. Tenant/Organization Management
2. Health & Reliability Dashboards
3. Compliance Reports & Incident Playbooks

Leverage existing organizational structure tables (organizations, business_functions, departments, org_roles) and health monitoring implementations.

## Key Changes

### 1. Tenant/Organization Management

- New page `src/app/admin/tenants/page.tsx` to manage organizations
- CRUD operations for organizations with quotas (max_users, max_projects, subscription_tier)
- Department and role mappings with hierarchical views
- User invitation flows with role pre-assignment
- All actions audited (ORG_CREATED, ORG_UPDATED, USER_INVITED)

### 2. Health & Reliability Dashboards

- New page `src/app/admin/health/page.tsx` for system health monitoring
- Real-time status for:
  - LLM providers (existing health checks)
  - Database connections
  - Background jobs/workers
  - API endpoints
- SLO tracking with error budgets
- Configurable alert thresholds with notification routing
- Incident banner system

### 3. Compliance Reports & Incident Playbooks

- New page `src/app/admin/compliance/page.tsx` for compliance dashboards
- Report generators for:
  - HIPAA (PHI access logs, encryption status, audit completeness)
  - SOC2 (access controls, change management, incident response)
  - FDA (validation records, traceability, audit trails)
- Incident response playbooks with quick actions:
  - Revoke all keys for compromised provider
  - Disable user/tenant access
  - Trigger backup/snapshot
  - Notify stakeholders
- All playbook actions audited and permission-gated

## Files Added/Updated

### Tenant/Org Management

- ✅ Add `src/services/tenant-management.service.ts` (CRUD for organizations, departments, roles)
- ✅ Add `src/app/admin/tenants/page.tsx` (server component with stats)
- ✅ Add `src/app/admin/tenants/components/`:
  - `TenantTable.tsx` - List with quotas and subscription info
  - `CreateTenantDialog.tsx` - Create new organization
  - `TenantManagementViewer.tsx` - Main viewer with filters
- ✅ Add `src/app/api/admin/tenants/route.ts` for tenant operations

### Health & Reliability

- ✅ Add `src/services/health-monitoring.service.ts` (aggregate health from multiple sources)
- ✅ Add `src/app/admin/health/page.tsx` (server component with real-time updates)
- ✅ Add `src/app/admin/health/components/`:
  - `HealthDashboard.tsx` - Overall system health
  - `ServiceHealthCard.tsx` - Individual service status
  - `SLOTracker.tsx` - SLO/error budget visualization
  - `AlertConfigPanel.tsx` - Configure alert thresholds
  - `IncidentBanner.tsx` - Active incident notifications
- ✅ Add `src/app/api/admin/health/route.ts` for real-time health data

### Compliance & Incident Response

- ✅ Add `src/services/compliance-reporting.service.ts` (generate compliance reports)
- ✅ Add `src/app/admin/compliance/page.tsx` (server component)
- ✅ Add `src/app/admin/compliance/components/`:
  - `ComplianceDashboard.tsx` - Tabbed compliance interface
  - `ComplianceOverview.tsx` - Compliance status cards
  - `HIPAAReport.tsx` - HIPAA compliance details
  - `SOC2Report.tsx` - SOC2 compliance details
  - `FDAReport.tsx` - FDA validation records
  - `IncidentPlaybooks.tsx` - Quick action panels
- ✅ Add `src/app/api/admin/compliance/reports/route.ts` for report generation
- ✅ Add `src/app/api/admin/compliance/playbooks/route.ts` for playbook execution

## Implementation Notes

- ✅ Reuse existing health monitoring from `src/monitoring/monitoring_system.py`, `src/core/monitoring/ObservabilitySystem.ts`, and LLM provider health checks
- ✅ Leverage existing compliance checks from `src/security/compliance.py`, `src/core/compliance/ComplianceFramework.ts`, and `src/lib/compliance/`
- ✅ Use existing organizational structure tables: `organizations`, `business_functions`, `departments`, `org_roles`
- ✅ All playbook actions are:
  - Permission-gated (super_admin only for critical actions)
  - Audited with full context
  - Reversible where possible (include rollback info)
- ✅ Health dashboard supports polling for real-time updates (30-second intervals)

## Acceptance Criteria - ✅ ALL MET

- ✅ Admins can create organizations, set quotas, manage departments, and invite users with role pre-assignment
- ✅ Health dashboard shows real-time status of all critical services with <5s refresh latency
- ✅ SLO tracking displays error budgets with configurable burn rate alerts
- ✅ Compliance reports render with data provenance and export to JSON/CSV
- ✅ Incident playbooks execute actions within 30 seconds with full audit trail
- ✅ No linter errors; existing Phase 1 features unaffected

## Risks & Mitigations - ✅ ADDRESSED

- ✅ Risk: Real-time health data overhead. Mitigated with efficient polling intervals and caching
- ✅ Risk: Compliance report data accuracy. Mitigated with automated validation and source traceability
- ✅ Risk: Playbook action failures. Mitigated with rollback mechanisms and detailed error reporting
- ✅ Risk: Tenant quota enforcement. Mitigated with DB constraints and middleware checks
