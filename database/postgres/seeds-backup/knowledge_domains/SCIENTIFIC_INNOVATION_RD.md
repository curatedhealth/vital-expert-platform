## Strategic Imperatives

### Pipeline Revitalization Indicators

Signs that R&D pipeline requires revitalization:
1. Declining R&D Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
2. High attrition rates in early and late-stage trials
3. Prolonged development timelines (>100 months)
4. Significant revenue at risk from patent expirations

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Bold Innovation** - Embrace breakthrough technologies and novel modalities
2. **Strategic Portfolio Management** - Balance risk across therapeutic areas and modalities
3. **Early-Stage Acquisitions** - Focus on promising innovation vs late-stage "gap plugging"
4. **AI Investment** - Scale gene editing, AI platforms, lab automation
5. **Efficient R&D Processes** - Optimize trial design and development workflows
6. **Thoughtful Trial Design** - Patient-centric, decentralized approaches

### M&A Strategy Shift
> "A shift towards smaller-scale, early-stage acquisitions focused on promising innovation, rather than late-stage acquisitions to 'plug the gaps', will be crucial for building a sustainable and robust pipeline."
> — Deloitte, 2025

## R&D Productivity Improvement Strategies

### Organizational Effectiveness (BCG)
> "Despite general challenges to productivity in biopharma R&D, a few companies continue to excel. The key is their superior organizational effectiveness, which enhances cooperative behavior among R&D staff."

### Focus on Core Strengths (BCG)
> "Concentrating R&D and commercialization resources and expertise on areas of core strength is the most effective way to cut through complexity, de-risk investments, and deliver results."

**Evidence:**
- Companies with 70%+ revenue from top 2 therapeutic areas: **65% increase in TSR**
- More diversified firms: only 19% TSR increase

### Technology Investment
- Gene editing platforms
- AI-powered drug development
- Lab automation (Lab-of-the-Future)
- Digital twins for trial simulation
