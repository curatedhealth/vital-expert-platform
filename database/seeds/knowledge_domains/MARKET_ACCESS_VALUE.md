# Knowledge Domain: Market Access & Value in Pharmaceutical Industry

## Domain Code: KD-MA-001

## Executive Summary

Market Access has become a critical determinant of pharmaceutical commercial success. Premium-priced medicines cannot succeed without first persuading payers and health technology assessors that they are worth the investment. The historical model of launching and refining access strategies over time is becoming obsolete—companies must ensure full payer engagement, HEOR readiness, and data-driven contracting strategies from the outset. The 2025 landscape is marked by HTA harmonization efforts, value-based contracting growth, and increasing payer scrutiny.

### Core Definition

> "Premium-priced medicines cannot succeed without first persuading payers and health technology assessors that they are worth the investment."
> — Tribeca Knowledge

### Key Success Factors

1. **Early Integration** - Market access perspective from early clinical development
2. **HEOR Readiness** - Evidence package prepared before launch
3. **Payer Engagement** - Full stakeholder engagement from outset
4. **Value Demonstration** - Clear articulation of clinical and economic value

## Health Technology Assessment (HTA)

### Global HTA Landscape

| Region | HTA Requirement | Key Bodies |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Europe | Required | NICE (UK), G-BA (Germany), HAS (France), AIFA (Italy) |
| Canada | Required | CADTH, INESSS |
| Australia | Required | PBAC |
| United States | Variable | ICER, Payer-specific |
| Japan | Growing | CHUIKEN |

### European Joint Clinical Assessment (JCA)

**Effective:** January 2025

**Key Changes:**
- Centralized assessment of clinical features at EU level
- Individual member states retain pricing & reimbursement authority
- Increased collaboration among national HTA bodies
- Standardized evidence requirements

### HTA Challenges

> "MA programmes are further complicated by persistent divergence in criteria across different countries, regions, and healthcare channels."
> — Tribeca Knowledge

## Value-Based Contracting

### Definition

Value-based contracts tie payment terms to clinical outcomes and effectiveness, representing a shift from volume-based to outcomes-based reimbursement.

### Contract Types

| Type | Description | Risk Allocation |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Outcomes-Based** | Payment tied to clinical results | Manufacturer bears outcome risk |
| **Risk-Share** | Rebates if outcomes not achieved | Shared risk |
| **Pay-for-Performance** | Premium for achieving benchmarks | Performance-linked |
| **Installment Payments** | Spread costs over time | Reduced upfront burden |
| **Cap Arrangements** | Maximum spend per patient/population | Cost containment |

### Industry Trends

> "The prevalence of value-based contracting is increasing as payers and providers seek to optimize healthcare expenditures while improving patient care."
> — Analysis Group

### Implementation Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Data Requirements | Outcome measurement infrastructure |
| Contract Complexity | Legal and operational challenges |
| Administration | Claims processing, reconciliation |
| Outcome Definitions | Clear, measurable endpoints |
| Time Horizon | Duration for outcome assessment |

---

## Health Economics & Outcomes Research (HEOR)

### HEOR Evidence Types

| Type | Purpose | HTA Application |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis** | Value for money | NICE, CADTH |
| **Budget Impact Analysis** | Financial planning | Payer decisions |
| **Comparative Effectiveness** | vs. alternatives | Formulary placement |
| **Patient-Reported Outcomes** | Quality of life | Value demonstration |
| **Real-World Evidence** | Post-launch data | Reimbursement renewal |

### QALYs and Thresholds

| Country/Body | QALY Threshold | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| UK (NICE) | £20,000-£30,000 | Higher for end-of-life |
| US (ICER) | $50,000-$150,000 | Range guidance |
| Canada (CADTH) | Variable | Case-by-case |
| Australia (PBAC) | ~A$50,000 | Implied threshold |

### Early Integration Imperative

> "Incorporating HEOR early in development ensures alignment with access goals. Teams that wait until launch to assemble this data often fall short in access negotiations."
> — Deloitte

---

## Real-World Evidence (RWE)

### Strategic Importance

> "Real-world evidence (RWE) is becoming increasingly vital for demonstrating a drug's value beyond controlled clinical trials. Companies that can effectively generate and leverage compelling RWE to support HTA submissions can justify premium pricing and secure favorable market access."
> — Deloitte

### RWE Applications

| Application | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| HTA Submissions | Support clinical benefit claims |
| Label Extensions | New indications evidence |
| Comparative Effectiveness | Real-world comparisons |
| Safety Monitoring | Post-market surveillance |
| Payer Negotiations | Value demonstration |

### Data Sources

| Source | Type | Strengths |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Claims Data | Administrative | Large populations |
| EHR Data | Clinical | Rich clinical detail |
| Registries | Disease-specific | Targeted populations |
| Wearables/Sensors | Digital biomarkers | Continuous monitoring |
| Patient Surveys | PROs | Patient perspective |

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Models

| Model | Description | Application |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Value-Based Pricing | Price reflects clinical value | Innovative therapies |
| Reference Pricing | Based on other countries | International launches |
| Cost-Plus Pricing | Cost + margin | Generics, mature products |
| Indication-Based | Different price per indication | Multi-indication drugs |
| Outcomes-Based | Payment tied to results | Gene therapies, specialty |

### Pricing Pressures

| Pressure | Source | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| IRA Provisions | Medicare negotiation (US) | Price reduction for selected drugs |
| International Reference Pricing | Multi-country reference | Downward price pressure |
| Biosimilar Competition | Patent expiry | Significant price erosion |
