  - Server-side and database-level enforcement:
    - Supabase RLS enabled on key tables (e.g., user_profiles, role_permissions, security_audit_log, encrypted_api_keys)
    - Helper SQL functions for `check_user_permission`, `is_admin_user`, etc.
    - All admin actions are permission-gated and audited

- **Audit Logging**
  - Central audit logging service (client + server) for security and compliance events
  - Domain-specific audit hooks (e.g., AgentService writes to audit tables)
  - Compliance framework includes audit trail utilities and storage via Supabase
  - Immutable audit storage with hash-chained integrity verification
  - SIEM export capabilities with multiple formats (JSON, CEF, LEEF)

### Gaps vs. Leading Practices

- **Admin UX and Coverage**
  - Missing dedicated UI for user and role management (create/disable users, assign roles, access reviews).
  - No tenant/organization management UI (orgs, departments, role mappings, quotas, lifecycle).
  - No first-class Audit Log Viewer (filters, export, retention banners, integrity hash indicators).
  - No API keys/secrets management UI (scoped tokens, rotation schedules, last-used data, JIT credentials).
  - No System Settings/Feature Flags UI (announcements, maintenance mode, release toggles).
  - Limited health/status dashboards (providers, queues, DB, background jobs) and SLO/error budget views.
  - No approval workflows for sensitive actions (prompt/version changes, provider changes) with reviewers and rollbacks.

- **Security & Identity**
  - Need strict route guards at layout/page level for `/admin` and admin sub-views (beyond links).
  - Enterprise SSO (SAML/OIDC/SCIM) not wired into admin lifecycle (JIT provisioning/deprovisioning).
  - MFA enforcement policies by role/tenant and session risk scoring/step-up auth.
  - Admin impersonation with consent banners and immutable audit of actions.
  - Periodic access reviews and automatic entitlement expiry.
  - Data masking/DLP for sensitive admin reads; PHI redaction in UI/log exports.

- **Audit & Compliance**
  - Tamper-evident, immutable audit storage (hash chaining, WORM, external SIEM export) not fully implemented in UI.
  - Coverage validation to ensure all privileged UI and API actions log comprehensive audit events.
  - In-app incident response playbooks and quick actions (e.g., revoke keys, disable integrations).
  - Compliance report UI (HIPAA, SOC2, FDA) backed by verifiable data sources.

- **Operations & Reliability**
  - Rate limiting and abuse detection configuration per tenant with admin-tunable thresholds.
  - Error budgets/SLO tracking and release freeze toggles during incidents.
  - Backup/restore orchestration UI for critical tables and knowledge artifacts.
  - Blue/green / canary controls for LLM provider/model changes.

- **Governance of Prompts/LLM**
  - Policy-as-code editor for safety/compliance rules with staged rollout, diff/approval workflows.
  - Prompt change management: versioning, reviewers, impact analysis, and rollback.

- **Observability & Cost**
  - Usage/cost dashboards by tenant with anomaly detection and budget alerts.
  - Alert routing configuration (email/Slack/PagerDuty) with on-call schedules and escalation.

### Recommendations and Phased Plan

#### Guiding Principles

- Prioritize least-privilege access, audit completeness, and operational safety first.
- Ship iteratively with clean, composable admin modules and strong acceptance criteria.
- Leverage existing RBAC, audit services, and Supabase RLS to accelerate delivery.

#### Phase 1 – Foundations (2–3 weeks)

1) Admin Route Guards and Enforcement
   - Add middleware/layout guards for `/admin` and admin views under `/dashboard/*`.
   - Enforce role checks (admin/super_admin) and show "forbidden" UX with audit logging on denials.
   - Acceptance: Non-admins cannot access admin pages via direct URL; denials are audited.

2) Audit Log Viewer (Read-Only)
   - Admin page to query `security_audit_log`/`audit_events` with filters (user, operation, resource, outcome, time window).
   - Export (CSV/JSON) and retention label; show integrity hash when available.
   - Acceptance: Admins can filter, paginate, and export logs; performance acceptable on 100k rows.

3) User & Role Management (MVP)
   - List users, view profile/role, enable/disable, assign roles within allowed scope.
   - All actions audited; permissions enforced via existing RBAC + SQL helpers.
   - Acceptance: Admins can adjust roles (not super_admin), disable/enable accounts with audit trails.

4) API Keys Management (MVP)
   - Create scoped tokens; copy-once display; list with last-used timestamp; rotate and revoke.
   - Acceptance: Keys are encrypted at rest, rotation is audited, scope enforced on access.

#### Phase 2 – Compliance & Operations (3–5 weeks)

5) Tenant/Org Management
   - Manage organizations, departments, role mappings, quotas; invite flows.
   - Acceptance: Admins can provision orgs, assign default roles, set quotas; audited.

6) Health & Reliability Dashboards
   - Providers/jobs/DB health with SLOs and error budgets; alert thresholds configurable.
   - Acceptance: Real-time status, incident banner, and configurable alert thresholds.

7) Compliance Reports & Incident Playbooks
   - HIPAA/SOC2/FDA report views; IR playbooks with quick actions (revoke keys, disable integrations).
   - Acceptance: Reports render with provenance; playbook actions are audited and permission-gated.

#### Phase 3 – Governance & Enterprise (4–6 weeks)

8) Prompt/LLM Governance
   - Policy-as-code editor, staged rollout, reviewers/approvals, version diff/rollback.
   - Acceptance: Changes require reviewer approval; rollout staged; full audit.

9) Identity Hardening
   - SSO (SAML/OIDC/SCIM), MFA enforcement, session risk scoring and step-up auth.
   - Acceptance: Enterprise SSO enabled; per-tenant MFA policy; risk-driven challenges.

10) Immutable Audit Storage & SIEM
   - Hash-chained/WORM storage and scheduled export/stream to SIEM; integrity verification in UI.
   - Acceptance: Integrity checks pass; exports verifiable; tamper-evidence surfaced in viewer.

### Success Criteria and KPIs

- 0 unauthorized admin page loads post-guards; 100% denied attempts audited.
- 100% privileged actions emit audit events with actor, scope, before/after, and integrity hash.
- Mean time to revoke credentials < 2 minutes via admin UI.
- SLO dashboards with <1% error budget burn sustained for core services.
- Reduction in admin-related incidents quarter-over-quarter.

### Dependencies and Risks

- Identity provider integration (SSO, SCIM) may require tenant contracts and staging.
- Audit storage scale: consider partitioning/indexing and background archiving.
- UI complexity: keep components modular to avoid regressions during expansion.

### Next Steps

- Implement Phase 1 with a small, vertical slice per module:
  - Admin guard + Audit viewer initial page + User/role list + API key list.
- Define data contracts (types, endpoints) for admin modules and wire to existing services.
- Schedule a security review of Phase 1 before enabling Phase 2 features.
