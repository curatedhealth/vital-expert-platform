# üö¶ START HERE - MA01 Implementation Guide
## This Tells You EXACTLY What to Do

---

## üìå YOU ONLY NEED 2 DOCUMENTS TO START

### 1. **THIS Document** (Start Here)
You're reading it now. It tells you what to do.
Location: `/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/START_HERE.md`

### 2. **Simple Execution Plan**
Contains all the prompts you'll copy-paste into Cursor.
Location: `/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/cursor_simple_execution_plan.md`

### That's it! Ignore the other documents for now.

## üìç YOUR FILE LOCATIONS

All your documents are in:
```
/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/
```

## üéØ YOUR IMPLEMENTATION PATH

### Step 1: Open These Things
- [ ] Open Cursor AI with your project
- [ ] Open the Simple Execution Plan at: `/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/cursor_simple_execution_plan.md`
- [ ] Have a terminal ready for git commands

### Step 2: Follow the Phases
- [ ] Start with **Phase 0: Setup**
- [ ] Copy the prompt from the plan
- [ ] Paste into Cursor
- [ ] Test it works
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] Move to next phase

### Step 3: Work Through All 6 Phases
```
Phase 0: Setup (30 min)
Phase 1: Database (30 min)  
Phase 2: API (45 min)
Phase 3: AI Agent (45 min)
Phase 4: UI (45 min)
Phase 5: Connect (30 min)
Phase 6: Polish (30 min)

Total: ~4 hours for basic system
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: When to Use Other Documents

### Use ONLY When Needed:

**If something breaks ‚Üí** Open:
```
/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/cursor_ai_troubleshooting_guide.md
```

**If you want to go deeper ‚Üí** Open:
```
/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/ma01_prd_ard_document.md
```

**If you finish basic and want advanced ‚Üí** Open:
```
/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/cursor_ai_implementation_prompts.md
```

**But 90% of the time, you only need the Simple Execution Plan!**

### During Implementation:
- [ ] Phase 0: Setup ‚úì
- [ ] Phase 1: Database ‚úì
- [ ] Phase 2: API ‚úì
- [ ] Phase 3: AI Agent ‚úì
- [ ] Phase 4: UI ‚úì
- [ ] Phase 5: Connect ‚úì
- [ ] Phase 6: Polish ‚úì

### After Completion:
- [ ] Jobs can be created
- [ ] AI processes queries
- [ ] Results show in UI
- [ ] Old features still work

## üöÄ LET'S START!

### Your EXACT Next Actions:

1. **Open** the Simple Execution Plan at:
   ```
   /Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/cursor_simple_execution_plan.md
   ```
2. **Find** Phase 0
3. **Copy** the first prompt
4. **Paste** into Cursor
5. **Follow** what Cursor says

That's literally it. Don't overthink it.

## üí° THREE RULES FOR SUCCESS

### Rule 1: Don't Read Everything
You DON'T need to read all documents. Just follow the phases.

### Rule 2: One Thing at a Time  
Do Phase 0 completely. Then Phase 1. Never skip ahead.

### Rule 3: Test and Commit
After each phase works, save it:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Phase X"
```

---

## üÜò IF YOU GET STUCK

### Option 1: Check if it's a common issue
```
@workspace The last change broke [X]. Please fix it while keeping new features.
```

### Option 2: Go back to last working version
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

### Option 3: Take a break
Sometimes stepping away for 10 minutes helps.

## üìû THE MENTAL MODEL

Think of it like building with LEGO:
1. **Phase 0**: Open the box, check pieces (Setup)
2. **Phase 1**: Build the base (Database)
3. **Phase 2**: Add the walls (API)
4. **Phase 3**: Add the roof (AI Agent)
5. **Phase 4**: Add windows (UI)
6. **Phase 5**: Add the door (Connect)
7. **Phase 6**: Paint it (Polish)

Each phase builds on the last. Don't skip steps.

---

## üéâ WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

After ~4 hours, you'll be able to:
1. Create a job with a medical question
2. Watch AI process it
3. See the answer with citations
4. Know your existing app still works perfectly

That's the whole goal!
