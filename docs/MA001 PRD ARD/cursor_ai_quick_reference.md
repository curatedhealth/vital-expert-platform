# Cursor AI Quick Reference Guide
## MA01 Implementation Checklist & Commands

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Step 1: Analyze Your Codebase
```
@workspace analyze the current codebase structure and list all major frameworks, libraries, and patterns we're using
```

### Step 2: Prepare for Modifications
```
@workspace before we start making changes, create a snapshot of the current working state and identify all files that will need modification for the MA01 medical intelligence system
```

---

## üìã Copy-Paste Prompt Sequences

### Database Schema Updates
```
@workspace look at our database schema files. Add jobs, workflows, and knowledge_documents tables following our existing schema patterns. Keep all existing tables. Generate migration files.
```

### API CRUD Endpoints
```
@workspace in our API routes, add CRUD endpoints for /jobs following our existing endpoint patterns. Use our current auth middleware, validation, and error handling. Don't create new patterns.
```

### RAG Integration
```
@workspace extend our search functionality to support RAG. Add hybrid search, confidence scoring, and VERIFY protocol validation. Keep existing search working.
```

### Agent System
```
@workspace create an agent orchestration system using our existing LLM client. Add literature_agent, clinical_trials_agent, and signal_detection_agent following our service patterns.
```

### React UI Updates
```
@workspace add job management UI to our dashboard. Use our existing table component, form patterns, and styling. Don't change the current design system.
```

### Workflow Builder
```
@workspace integrate ReactFlow for visual workflow building. Use our existing modal system and drag-drop if available. Match our current theme.
```

---

## üîß Framework-Specific Commands

### Next.js
```
@workspace add /jobs routes in our app directory following our routing pattern. Use our existing layout and loading states. Add API routes in /api/jobs.
```

### Express
```
@workspace create jobRouter in our routes directory following our existing router pattern. Mount it in app.js like our other routers. Use our middleware stack.
```

### FastAPI
```
@workspace add jobs router following our existing FastAPI patterns. Use our dependencies, schemas, and response models. Include in main app.
```

### Prisma
```
@workspace update schema.prisma with new models. Keep existing models. Add relations using our foreign key pattern. Generate migrations and types.
```

### TypeORM
```
@workspace create Job and Workflow entities following our existing entity patterns. Use our decorators and relations approach. Generate migration.
```

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### After Each Major Change

```
@workspace verify that:
1. All existing API endpoints still work
2. User authentication is not broken
3. Database queries execute correctly
4. UI components render properly
5. Tests pass
Report any issues.
```

---

## üîç Common Fixes

### When Something Breaks
```
@workspace the last change broke [feature]. Fix it while keeping new functionality. Ensure backward compatibility.
```

### When Types Don't Match (TypeScript)
```
@workspace fix TypeScript errors by updating our type definitions. Follow our existing type patterns. Don't use 'any'.
```

### When Tests Fail
```
@workspace update failing tests to account for new functionality. Don't remove test coverage. Follow our testing patterns.
```

### When Performance Degrades
```
@workspace optimize the recent changes. Add indexes, implement caching like we do elsewhere, use pagination.
```

---

## üìù Documentation Updates

### API Documentation
```
@workspace update our API documentation to include new endpoints. Follow our existing documentation format. Include examples.
```

### README Updates
```
@workspace update README.md with new setup instructions and environment variables. Keep existing content.
```

### Type Definitions
```
@workspace generate TypeScript definitions for new API responses. Follow our interface naming convention.
```

## üí° Power User Tips

### Use File Context
```
@workspace @file:src/api/routes/users.js create similar routes for jobs using this file as a template
```
