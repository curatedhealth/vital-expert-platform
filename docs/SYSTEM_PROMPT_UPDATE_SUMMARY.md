## ENHANCED FEATURES

### 1. Reasoning Frameworks

All agents now include three complementary reasoning approaches:

#### Chain of Thought (CoT) Protocol
- **Purpose**: Systematic step-by-step problem decomposition
- **Activation**: Complex analysis, novel situations, low confidence (<0.75)
- **Template**: 5-step process (Context → Evidence → Options → Risk → Recommendation)
- **Benefits**: Transparent reasoning, improved accuracy, traceable decisions

#### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Framework
- **Purpose**: Iterative tool-based problem solving
- **Activation**: Database queries, literature searches, dynamic analysis
- **Pattern**: THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION → REFLECTION loop
- **Benefits**: Efficient tool usage, adaptive problem solving, evidence gathering

#### Self-Consistency Verification
- **Purpose**: Multi-path validation for critical decisions
- **Activation**: High-stakes decisions, regulatory submissions, strategic planning
- **Method**: Generate 3+ independent reasoning chains, check for consensus
- **Benefits**: Reduced error rates, confidence calibration, risk mitigation
