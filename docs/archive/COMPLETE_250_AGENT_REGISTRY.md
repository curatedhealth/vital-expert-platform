## Architecture: Hybrid Approach

### Database-Driven Agents (287 agents)
**Purpose**: Scalable information retrieval and task execution
- Configuration stored in Supabase database
- No custom code - just model + prompt + capabilities
- Easy to create and manage
- **Best for**: Single-step tasks, information queries, large-scale library

### TypeScript Class-Based Agents (21 agents in `/src/agents/`)
**Purpose**: Complex workflows and orchestration
- Custom TypeScript classes with business logic
- Can coordinate multiple database agents
- State management and error handling
- **Best for**: Multi-step workflows, agent collaboration, complex decision trees

### Why Both?
The hybrid architecture is powerful:
- **287 database agents** = Broad specialized knowledge
- **21 TypeScript orchestrators** = Complex workflow coordination
- **Integration** = TypeScript classes call database agents as needed

Example:
```typescript
// TypeScript orchestrator uses database agents
class ClinicalTrialOrchestrator {
  async designTrial(params) {
    // 1. Call database agent for biostatistics
    const stats = await callAgent('biostatistics_consultant');

    // 2. Call database agent for regulatory strategy
    const regulatory = await callAgent('regulatory_strategy_advisor');

    // 3. Custom orchestration logic
    return this.combineAndValidate(stats, regulatory);
  }
}
```

## Verification Queries

### Check total count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents WHERE status = 'active';
-- Expected: 287
```

### Check by tier:
```sql
SELECT tier, COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY tier
ORDER BY tier;
-- Expected: Tier 1: 118, Tier 2: 119, Tier 3: 50
```

### Check by model:
```sql
SELECT model, tier, COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY model, tier
ORDER BY tier, count DESC;
```

### Sample agents by business function:
```sql
SELECT business_function, COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY business_function
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
