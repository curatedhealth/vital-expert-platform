## ⚠️ Critical Blockers for Production

### 🚫 Missing Test Infrastructure (Critical)
```
Test Coverage: 0%
Unit Tests: None found
Integration Tests: None found
End-to-End Tests: None found
```
**Impact:** Cannot validate functionality or prevent regressions
**Effort:** 24 hours to implement basic testing framework

### 🚫 Security Vulnerabilities (Critical)
```
Input Validation: Not implemented
Rate Limiting: Missing
SQL Injection Testing: Not performed
XSS Protection: Not verified
