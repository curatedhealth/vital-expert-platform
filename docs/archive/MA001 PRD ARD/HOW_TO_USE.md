## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ‚ùå DON'T Do This:
- Open all 10 documents at once
- Read everything before starting
- Jump between documents randomly
- Try to understand everything first
- Skip phases

### ‚úÖ DO This Instead:
- Open only 3 documents
- Start with Phase 0 immediately
- Follow phases in order
- Test after each phase
- Commit when working

---

## üÜò EMERGENCY HELP

### If Confused About Where to Start:
```bash
open "/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/START_HERE.md"
```
This document tells you everything.

### If Something Breaks:
```bash
open "/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/cursor_ai_troubleshooting_guide.md"
```

## üí° THE SECRET TO SUCCESS

### The Formula:
```
Simple Path + Clear Prompts + Small Steps = Success
```

### The Process:
```
1. Copy prompt from guide
2. Paste into Cursor
3. Test it works
4. Commit changes
5. Next phase
```

### The Mindset:
```
- Don't overthink
- Don't read ahead
- Don't customize yet
- Just follow phases
```

## ‚úÖ FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE STARTING

- [ ] I know my documents are in: `/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/`
- [ ] I will start with START_HERE.md
- [ ] I will follow cursor_simple_execution_plan.md phases
- [ ] I will keep cursor_one_page_cheatsheet.md visible
- [ ] I will NOT open other documents unless needed
- [ ] I understand this takes ~4 hours
- [ ] I will do one phase at a time

## üöÄ BEGIN NOW!

```bash
# Your first command - copy and run this:
open "/Users/hichamnaim/Downloads/Cursor/VITAL path/MA001 PRD ARD/START_HERE.md"
```

**That's it! You're ready to build MA01!**

Remember: Confusion comes from too much information. Success comes from following a simple path. You have the simple path. Follow it.
