## üîë Key Success Factors

### 1. Always Specify Context
```javascript
// Start each session with:
"I'm working on an existing [framework] application with [database] and [auth system]"
```

### 2. Reference Existing Code
```javascript
// Always point to examples:
"Follow the same pattern as [file path]"
```

### 3. Test Incrementally
```javascript
// After each major change:
"Verify that [existing feature] still works"
```

### 4. Maintain Consistency
```javascript
// Enforce patterns:
"Use our existing [pattern] not a new approach"
```

### 5. Document Changes
```javascript
// Track modifications:
"Add a comment explaining what was changed and why"
```
