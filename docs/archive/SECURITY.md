| < 1.0   | ❌ No             | Not Compliant        |

## Security Standards

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Access controls, workforce training, incident response
- **Physical Safeguards**: Facility controls, workstation security, device controls
- **Technical Safeguards**: Access control, audit controls, integrity controls, transmission security

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS / Azure Key Vault integration
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Medical AI Safety
- **PHARMA Framework**: All medical responses validated against P.H.A.R.M.A. criteria
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Medical advice requires >80% confidence
- **Human Review**: Critical medical decisions require human oversight
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all medical interactions

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

⚠️ **Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities**

### For Healthcare-Related Vulnerabilities
If you discover a vulnerability that could affect patient safety or HIPAA compliance:

1. **Email**: security@vitalpath.healthcare
2. **Subject**: "URGENT - Healthcare Security Vulnerability"
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact on patient data or medical safety
   - Your assessment of severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

### For General Security Issues
For non-healthcare security issues:

1. **Email**: security@vitalpath.healthcare
2. **Subject**: "Security Vulnerability Report"
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

## Response Process

### Timeline
- **Healthcare Critical**: 4 hours acknowledgment, 24 hours initial response
- **Healthcare High**: 24 hours acknowledgment, 72 hours initial response
- **General Critical**: 24 hours acknowledgment, 7 days initial response
- **General Non-Critical**: 7 days acknowledgment, 30 days response

### Our Process
1. **Acknowledgment**: We confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: Our security team investigates the issue
3. **Validation**: We validate the vulnerability and assess impact
4. **Remediation**: We develop and test a fix
5. **Disclosure**: We coordinate disclosure with you
6. **Recognition**: We acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow secure coding practices
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Use parameterized queries for database access

### Healthcare-Specific Guidelines
- Never log PHI (Protected Health Information)
- Encrypt all sensitive data before storage
- Implement audit logging for all data access
- Follow least privilege principles
- Validate all medical content through proper frameworks

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Monitor security advisories for critical dependencies
- Prefer dependencies with strong security track records

## Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Scanning
- **HIPAA Compliance Scanner**: Runs on every commit
- **Security Linting**: ESLint security rules enforced
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **SAST (Static Analysis)**: Semgrep security analysis

### Manual Reviews
- Security code reviews for all changes
- Monthly security assessments
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual compliance audits

## Incident Response

### Classification
- **P0 (Critical)**: Patient safety risk, PHI breach
- **P1 (High)**: Security vulnerability, data exposure risk
- **P2 (Medium)**: Potential security issue, needs investigation
- **P3 (Low)**: Security improvement opportunity

### Response Team
- **Security Lead**: security@vitalpath.healthcare
- **Healthcare Compliance**: compliance@vitalpath.healthcare
- **Technical Team**: engineering@vitalpath.healthcare

## Security Contacts

- **General Security**: security@vitalpath.healthcare
