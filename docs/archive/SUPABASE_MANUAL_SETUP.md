# VITAL Path - Manual Supabase Setup Guide

Since you have your Supabase credentials configured, here's how to manually complete the database setup:

## ✅ Current Status
- **Supabase project**: Connected ✅
- **Environment variables**: Configured ✅
- **Most tables**: Already exist ✅
- **Missing**: `knowledge_documents` table for document uploads

## 🔧 Manual Setup Steps

### Step 1: Complete the Database Schema

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Navigate to**: SQL Editor
3. **Run the knowledge_documents creation script**:
   - Copy the contents of `create-knowledge-documents-table.sql`
   - Paste and execute in the SQL Editor

### Step 2: Enable Required Extensions (if not already enabled)

In Supabase Dashboard -> Database -> Extensions, enable:
- ✅ `uuid-ossp` (for UUID generation)
- ✅ `pgvector` (for vector embeddings - optional but recommended)

### Step 3: Verify Your Database Tables

Your database should now have all these tables:
- ✅ `organizations`
- ✅ `user_profiles`
- ✅ `projects`
- ✅ `ai_agents`
- ✅ `llm_providers`
- ✅ `chat_conversations`
- ✅ `chat_messages`
- ✅ `prompts`
- 🆕 `knowledge_documents`
- 🆕 `document_chunks`

### Step 4: Test the Frontend Connection

With all tables in place, your frontend is ready to use:

```bash
# Test the connection (should show 10/10 passed)
npm run db:supabase:test
