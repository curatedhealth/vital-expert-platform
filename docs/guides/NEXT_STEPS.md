2. ‚úÖ Downgraded 55 over-tiered agents to Tier-2
3. ‚úÖ Added evidence to 164 inactive Tier-2 agents
4. ‚úÖ All agents now have academic citations and model justifications
5. ‚úÖ Safety-critical agents meet highest accuracy standards

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Test Transformed Agents in UI ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Status:** Browser opened to http://localhost:3000/agents

**Actions:**
- [ ] Verify all 119 active agents display correctly
- [ ] Check agent cards show evidence (model_justification visible)
- [ ] Test editing an agent (update display_name or description)
- [ ] Confirm tier badges show correctly (Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3)
- [ ] Test chat with a transformed agent

**Expected Results:**
- All agents load successfully
- Evidence metadata visible in agent details
- Updates save without errors
- Chat functionality works with transformed agents

---

### 2. Fix Minor Schema Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW PRIORITY
**Priority:** LOW (not blocking core functionality)
**Time:** 30 minutes

**Errors to Address:**
1. Missing tables (non-critical):
   - `org_functions` - organizational structure feature
   - `llm_providers` - LLM provider management
   - `agent_prompts` - prompt starter templates

**Actions:**
- [ ] Create missing tables if features are needed
- [ ] OR remove references from code if features unused
- [ ] Restart Supabase to refresh schema cache

**Note:** These errors don't affect agent functionality. Chat and agent management work fine.

---

### 3. Activate High-Value Agents üöÄ RECOMMENDED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Ready to activate:** 164 inactive Tier-2 agents

- *10 more from clinical domain*

**Batch 2: Regulatory & Compliance (20 agents)**
- Regulatory Intelligence Analyst
- CMC Regulatory Specialist
- GMP Compliance Advisor
- Quality Systems Auditor
- Deviation Investigator
- Change Control Manager
- Document Control Specialist
- Training Coordinator

**Activation Script:**
```bash
# Activate specific agents by ID or name
curl -X PUT "https://xazinxsiglqokwfmogyk.supabase.co/rest/v1/agents?name=eq.clinical-data-manager" \
  -H "apikey: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "active"}'
```

**Or create a batch activation script:**
```javascript
// scripts/activate-agents-batch.js
const BATCH_1_AGENTS = [
  'clinical-data-manager',
  'clinical-protocol-writer',
  // ... add names
];

for (const name of BATCH_1_AGENTS) {
  await supabase
    .from('agents')
    .update({ status: 'active' })
    .eq('name', name);
}
```

### 4. Monitor Performance & Gather Feedback üìä ONGOING
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Time:** Ongoing

**Metrics to Track:**
- [ ] Agent usage statistics (which agents are used most)
- [ ] Chat success rate (conversations that resolve user queries)
- [ ] Average response time per tier
- [ ] Cost per query by tier
- [ ] User satisfaction ratings

**Tools:**
- Browser DevTools (Network tab for API calls)
- Supabase Dashboard (query performance)
- Application logs (error tracking)

---

### 5. System Prompt Enhancement (Phase 4) üîÆ FUTURE
**Priority:** OPTIONAL
**Time:** 2-3 days
**Status:** Not started

**Objective:** Implement 6-section system prompt framework for all agents

**6-Section Framework:**
1. **YOU ARE:** Role definition
2. **YOU DO:** Core capabilities
3. **YOU NEVER:** Safety boundaries
4. **SUCCESS CRITERIA:** Measurable outcomes
5. **WHEN UNSURE:** Escalation protocols
6. **EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:** Citation standards

**Approach:**
- Assign persona archetypes to all 283 agents
- Generate unique prompts using templates
- Add EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS section
- Validate with test scenarios

**Scripts to Create:**
- `scripts/assign-personas.js` - Assign 10 persona archetypes
- `scripts/generate-system-prompts.js` - Generate unique prompts
- `scripts/validate-prompts.js` - Test prompt quality

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If agents don't load:
1. Check Supabase is running: `docker ps | grep supabase`
2. Restart Supabase: `npx supabase restart`
3. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`

### If updates fail:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify service role key in `.env.local`
3. Check API route logs in terminal

### If chat doesn't work:
1. Verify OpenAI API key in `.env.local`
2. Check LangChain service logs
3. Test with a simple query first

## üí° Recommendations

### Priority 1: Test UI
- Spend 15-30 minutes testing the UI
- Verify transformation was successful
- Document any issues found

### Priority 2: Activate 20 Agents
- Choose high-value clinical/regulatory agents
- Activate in small batches (5-10 at a time)
- Test each batch before activating more

### Priority 3: Monitor Usage
- Track which agents are used most
- Gather user feedback
- Iterate on agent quality

### Priority 4 (Optional): Enhance Prompts
- Only if you want to take quality to next level
- Not required for production readiness
- Can be done iteratively over time

## ‚ùì Questions to Consider

1. **Which 20 agents should we activate first?**
   - Based on user demand?
   - Based on business value?
   - Based on completeness of capabilities?

2. **What metrics should we track?**
   - Usage frequency?
   - User satisfaction?
   - Cost per query?
   - Response accuracy?

3. **When should we deploy to production?**
   - After activating more agents?
   - After gathering feedback?
   - After enhancing system prompts?

4. **Do we need the missing tables?**
   - `org_functions` for organizational structure?
   - `llm_providers` for provider management?
   - `agent_prompts` for prompt templates?
