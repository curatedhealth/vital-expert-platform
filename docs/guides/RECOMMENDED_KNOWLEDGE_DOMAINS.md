## üí° Domain Design Principles

### 1. **Granularity Balance**
- Not too broad: "Healthcare" ‚ùå
- Not too narrow: "FDA_510k_Class_II_Cardiovascular_Devices" ‚ùå
- Just right: "medical_devices" with sub-domain "510k_pathway" ‚úÖ

### 2. **Agent Coverage**
- Each domain should support 5+ agents minimum
- Target 80/20 rule: 15 domains cover 80% of agents

### 3. **Query Patterns**
- Domains should align with natural query patterns
- Example: "What are FDA requirements for..." ‚Üí `regulatory_affairs`

### 4. **Cross-Functional Support**
- Domains can overlap (e.g., "clinical_development" + "biostatistics")
- Agents can subscribe to multiple domains

### 5. **Future-Proof**
- Leave room for emerging domains
- Design for extensibility

---

## üéØ Quick Start Recommendation

**Start with these 10 domains** (covers 90% of agents):

1. ‚úÖ `regulatory_affairs` (Regulatory & Compliance)
2. ‚úÖ `clinical_development` (Clinical Trials)
3. ‚úÖ `pharmacovigilance` (Drug Safety)
4. ‚úÖ `quality_management` (QA/QC)
5. ‚úÖ `drug_development` (R&D)
6. ‚úÖ `medical_affairs` (Medical Communications)
7. ‚úÖ `commercial_strategy` (Market Access)
8. ‚úÖ `clinical_data_analytics` (Biostatistics)
9. ‚úÖ `digital_health` (Health Technology)
10. ‚úÖ `manufacturing_operations` (CMC)

**These 10 domains align perfectly with your organizational structure** and support the vast majority of your agent capabilities.
