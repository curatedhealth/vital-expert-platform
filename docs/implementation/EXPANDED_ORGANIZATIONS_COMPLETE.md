|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Pharmaceutical** | 75 | 30% |
| **Digital Health** | 119 | 47% |
| **Biotech** | 🔄 Pending | ~10-15% expected |
| **MedTech** | 🔄 Pending | ~8-12% expected |
| **Payer** | 🔄 Pending | ~5-10% expected |
| **Consulting** | 🔄 Pending | ~30-40% expected |

**Note**: Agents can be mapped to multiple organizations simultaneously

### Mapping Strategy

The intelligent mapping system uses:
- **Keyword matching**: Agent names → Role names
- **Category matching**: Agent categories → Organization functions
- **Pattern recognition**: Specialized terminology detection
- **Multi-org support**: Each agent can have multiple role assignments
