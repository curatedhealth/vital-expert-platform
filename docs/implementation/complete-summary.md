## 🎯 Built-In Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Polling ⚡
- **Flow**: All experts respond simultaneously
- **Use Case**: Fast breadth of opinions
- **Rounds**: 1
- **Example**: Quick market assessment

### Pattern 2: Sequential Roundtable 🔄
- **Flow**: Experts respond one-by-one, seeing previous responses
- **Use Case**: Building on each other's insights
- **Rounds**: 1 (sequential through all experts)
- **Example**: Strategy development

### Pattern 3: Free Debate 💬
- **Flow**: Multi-round with convergence detection
- **Use Case**: Resolving conflicting viewpoints
- **Rounds**: Up to 3 (stops when converged)
- **Example**: Go/No-Go decisions

### Pattern 4: Funnel & Filter 🔽
- **Flow**: Parallel → Cluster themes → Sequential deep dive
- **Use Case**: Complex multi-faceted issues
- **Rounds**: 2 (breadth + depth)
- **Example**: Product launch strategy

   - Add/remove experts mid-session
   - Detect expertise gaps
   - Recruit additional specialists

6. **Open Discussion Format**
   - Time-based dynamic turns
   - Agents respond when they have input
   - Natural conversation flow

### Low Priority 🟢

7. **User Private Library**
   - Save custom agents
   - Save custom board templates
   - Track session history
   - Performance analytics

8. **Board Templates Store**
   - Marketplace of pre-configured boards
   - Categories (Digital Health, Market Access, etc.)
   - Ratings and reviews
   - Usage statistics

## 🏗️ Database Schema

Current tables (already implemented):

- `board_session` - Panel sessions
- `board_reply` - Expert responses
- `board_synthesis` - Consensus/dissent summaries
- `evidence_pack` - RAG evidence sources
- `board_panel_member` - Panel composition

Missing tables (for User Library feature):

- `user_custom_agents` - User's custom agents
- `user_board_templates` - User's saved boards
- `user_board_sessions` - Session history

---

## 📝 Example Session

**Question**: "Should we launch our diabetes medication now or wait 6 months?"

**Board**: Market Access Advisory Board
- Chair: Market Access Strategist (weight: 1.5)
- Clinical Research Director (weight: 1.2)
- Health Economics Analyst (weight: 1.0)
- Patient Advocacy Representative (weight: 1.0)
- FDA Regulatory Expert (weight: 1.2)

**Mode**: Debate (3 rounds)

**Result**:
```
Consensus (70% agreement):
- Wait 6 months for additional RWE data
- Strengthen payer value proposition
- Address patient access concerns

Dissent:
- Regulatory Expert: "Current data sufficient for approval"

Recommendation:
Delay launch by 6 months. Use time to:
1. Gather real-world evidence
2. Refine pricing strategy
3. Develop patient support program

Human Gate Required: Yes (due to dissent on timing)
```
