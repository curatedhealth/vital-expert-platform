## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

All 7 orchestration modes have been implemented based on your comprehensive LangGraph guide for pharmaceutical virtual advisory boards.

---

## ✅ **ALL 7 ORCHESTRATION MODES IMPLEMENTED**

### **File:** `src/lib/services/orchestration-engine.ts`

### **1. Parallel Polling** ✅
- **Purpose:** Quick breadth across all personas
- **Flow:** All experts respond simultaneously → synthesis
- **Use Case:** Quick pulse check on regulatory endpoints
- **Pharma Example:** "What are payer-acceptable surrogate endpoints for psoriasis?"

### **2. Sequential Roundtable** ✅
- **Purpose:** Deep dialogue with building context
- **Flow:** Expert 1 → Expert 2 (builds on 1) → Expert 3 (builds on 1+2)
- **Use Case:** Clinical trial design deliberation
- **Pharma Example:** KOL → Biostatistician → Payer (each referencing prior)

### **3. Scripted Interview** ✅
- **Purpose:** Structured Q&A following interview guide
- **Flow:** Section 1 (parallel) → Section 2 (sequential) → Section 3
- **Use Case:** Mock regulatory panel rehearsal
- **Pharma Example:** FDA submission preparation with predefined questions

### **4. Free Debate** ✅
- **Purpose:** Adversarial cross-talk with multiple rounds
- **Flow:** Round 1 (all respond) → Round 2 (challenge) → Round 3 (converge)
- **Use Case:** Ethics deliberations
- **Pharma Example:** Patient data sharing policy debate

### **5. Funnel & Filter** ✅
- **Purpose:** Breadth → clustering → depth on top themes
- **Flow:** Parallel (generate options) → Cluster → Sequential (top 3 themes)
- **Use Case:** Brand strategy generation
- **Pharma Example:** Launch positioning options → cluster → deep dive top 3

### **6. Scenario Simulation** ✅
- **Purpose:** Role-play future scenarios (e.g., 2030 market)
- **Flow:** Define scenario → assign roles → experts role-play → identify EWIs
- **Use Case:** Foresight wargaming
- **Pharma Example:** 2030 psoriasis market with digital therapeutics disruption

### **7. Dynamic Orchestration** ✅
- **Purpose:** Adaptive mode switching based on panel state
- **Flow:** Start parallel → analyze disagreement → switch to debate/sequential
- **Use Case:** Enterprise foresight with adaptive facilitation
- **Metrics:**
  - High disagreement (>0.6) → Debate
  - High uncertainty (>0.5) → Sequential
  - Default → Parallel

## 🚀 **Usage Example**

```typescript
import { orchestrationEngine } from '@/lib/services/orchestration-engine';

// Example 1: Parallel Polling
const result = await orchestrationEngine.orchestrate({
  mode: 'parallel',
  question: 'What are optimal endpoints for psoriasis trial?',
  personas: ['KOL', 'Biostatistician', 'Payer', 'Regulator'],
  evidenceSources: [...] // EMA/FDA sources
});

// Example 2: Scenario Simulation (2030)
const futureResult = await orchestrationEngine.orchestrate({
  mode: 'scenario',
  question: 'How will digital therapeutics impact psoriasis treatment?',
  personas: ['Payer', 'HCP', 'Patient', 'Regulator'],
  scenarioContext: {
    name: 'Digital Health Disruption',
    year: 2030,
    assumptions: { aiDiagnostics: true, personalizedMeds: 'common' },
    roleAssignments: {
      'Payer': 'European Payer 2030',
      'HCP': 'Digital-Native Dermatologist'
    }
  }
});

// Example 3: Dynamic (Adaptive)
const dynamicResult = await orchestrationEngine.orchestrate({
  mode: 'dynamic',
  question: 'Should we pursue orphan drug designation?',
  personas: ['CSO', 'CFO', 'Regulator', 'Market Access']
  // Engine will automatically switch modes based on disagreement/uncertainty
});
```
