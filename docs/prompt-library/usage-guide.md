# ðŸ“– VITAL Path Prompt Library Usage Guide

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Phase
Start with the phase that matches your current development stage:

- **Phase 0**: If you're just starting and need to understand requirements
- **Phase 1**: If you're designing the system architecture
- **Phase 2**: If you're building data models and knowledge systems
- **Phase 3**: If you're implementing AI agents and intelligence
- **Phase 4**: If you're creating user interfaces
- **Phase 5**: If you're optimizing and validating
- **Phase 6**: If you're integrating with external systems
- **Phase 7**: If you're preparing for production launch

### 2. Select the Right Prompt
Each phase contains multiple prompts. Choose based on your specific needs:

- **Architecture prompts** for system design
- **Data prompts** for database and knowledge management
- **AI prompts** for machine learning and agents
- **UI prompts** for user interface development
- **Integration prompts** for connecting external systems
- **Testing prompts** for validation and compliance

### 3. Customize for Your Context
Before using any prompt:

1. **Replace placeholders** with your specific requirements
2. **Adjust scope** based on your team size and timeline
3. **Add context** about your existing systems
4. **Specify constraints** like budget, timeline, or technology stack

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact requirements, constraints, and success criteria
2. **Provide Context**: Give background about your healthcare domain focus
3. **Include Examples**: Show the AI what good output looks like
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on initial results
5. **Validate**: Always verify AI-generated code and recommendations

### Medical Safety Guidelines

1. **Never skip validation**: All medical recommendations must be validated
2. **Include citations**: Every medical claim needs proper references
3. **Escalate uncertainty**: When confidence is low, involve human experts
4. **Document decisions**: Keep audit trails for all clinical decisions
5. **Test thoroughly**: Use comprehensive test suites for medical accuracy

### Compliance Considerations

1. **HIPAA first**: Design with privacy and security from the start
2. **Audit everything**: Log all actions and decisions
3. **Encrypt data**: Use proper encryption for all PHI
4. **Control access**: Implement role-based access controls
5. **Plan for breaches**: Have incident response procedures ready

7. Apply **Phase 6.2** for trial database integration
8. Finish with **Phase 7.1** for compliance testing

### Developing a Medical Literature Analysis Tool

1. Start with **Phase 0.1** for regulatory landscape
2. Use **Phase 1.2** for knowledge system design
3. Apply **Phase 2.2** for literature processing pipeline
4. Implement **Phase 3.2** for RAG system
5. Create **Phase 4.3** for query interface
6. Use **Phase 5.1** for performance optimization
7. Apply **Phase 6.3** for regulatory database integration
8. Finish with **Phase 7.2** for documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Prompt not specific enough**
- Add more details about your specific use case
- Include examples of desired output
- Specify technology stack and constraints

**AI generating generic code**
- Provide more context about your existing codebase
- Include specific requirements and edge cases
- Ask for code that integrates with your current systems

**Medical accuracy concerns**
- Always include validation requirements
- Specify confidence thresholds
- Add expert review escalation triggers

**Compliance issues**
- Include specific regulatory requirements
- Add audit logging requirements
- Specify data protection measures

### Getting Help

1. **Check the quick reference** for common commands
2. **Review examples** in each phase file
3. **Customize prompts** for your specific needs
4. **Test incrementally** to catch issues early
5. **Involve experts** for medical and compliance validation

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Prompts

You can combine multiple prompts for complex features:

```markdown
# Example: Building a comprehensive clinical platform

1. Use Phase 1.1 for overall architecture
2. Combine with Phase 2.1 for data models
3. Add Phase 3.1 for AI agents
4. Include Phase 4.1 for user interface
5. Apply Phase 5.3 for validation
6. Use Phase 6.1 for EHR integration
7. Finish with Phase 7.1 for compliance
```

### Customizing for Your Domain

1. **Replace medical terms** with your specific domain
2. **Adjust regulatory requirements** for your geography
3. **Modify data models** for your specific use cases
4. **Customize UI components** for your user base
5. **Adapt integration patterns** for your systems

### Scaling for Large Teams
