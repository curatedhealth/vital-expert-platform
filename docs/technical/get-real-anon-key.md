# Get Real Supabase Anon Key

## 🚀 Instructions to get your actual Supabase Anon Key:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xazinxsiglqokwfmogyk
2. **Click on "Settings" in the left sidebar**
3. **Click on "API"**
4. **Copy the "anon public" key** (it should start with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`)

## ⚠️ Important:
The anon key I used was a placeholder. I need the REAL anon key from your dashboard to complete the setup.

## 📋 What we've accomplished so far:
- ✅ Database schema is set up
- ✅ Data is seeded (2 LLM providers, 30 knowledge domains, 162+ agents)
- ✅ Vercel environment variables are updated with cloud URLs
- ✅ Application is deployed

## 🔑 Next Step:
Please provide the real anon key so I can:
1. Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Vercel
2. Test the platform functionality
3. Complete the migration

Once you provide the anon key, the platform will be fully functional with your cloud database!
