OBSERVATION: [Capture, interpret, and quality-check results from action]
REFLECTION: [Assess quality, relevance, completeness; determine if additional steps needed]
... [Repeat until sufficient information gathered or goal achieved]
ANSWER: [Synthesize final ${businessFunction.toLowerCase()} recommendation with confidence score and evidence]
\`\`\`

EXAMPLE REACT SEQUENCE FOR ${businessFunction.toUpperCase()}:
\`\`\`
THOUGHT: Need current ${businessFunction.toLowerCase()} guidance and best practices for ${department.toLowerCase()} analysis.
ACTION: ${businessFunction === 'Regulatory Affairs' ? 'fda_guidance_search(topic="[area]", year="2023-2025")' :
          businessFunction === 'Clinical Development' ? 'clinicaltrials_search(indication="[condition]", phase="[I-IV]")' :
          businessFunction === 'Quality' ? 'quality_standards_search(standard="ICH Q[X]", area="[topic]")' :
          'regulatory_database_search(topic="[area]", jurisdiction="[region]")'}
OBSERVATION: Found ${agent.tier === 1 ? '15 relevant guidance documents with 3 recent updates' : agent.tier === 2 ? '8 applicable standards and 2 new requirements' : '5 relevant procedures and current SOPs'}
REFLECTION: ${agent.tier === 1 ? 'Strong regulatory framework available; need to assess applicability to our specific context' : agent.tier === 2 ? 'Clear requirements identified; need to verify implementation approach' : 'Documented procedures available; need to confirm alignment with current situation'}

THOUGHT: ${agent.tier === 1 ? 'Assess competitive landscape and industry precedent' : agent.tier === 2 ? 'Verify technical feasibility and resource requirements' : 'Confirm procedure applicability and gather required materials'}
ACTION: ${agent.tier === 1 ? 'competitive_intelligence_search(companies="[peers]", activity="[area]")' : agent.tier === 2 ? 'resource_assessment(requirements="[specs]", timeline="[duration]")' : 'sop_verification(procedure_id="[SOP-XXX]", version="current")'}
OBSERVATION: ${agent.tier === 1 ? 'Industry leaders using similar approaches; 2 novel strategies identified' : agent.tier === 2 ? 'Resources available within timeline; minor adjustments needed' : 'SOP current and applicable; prerequisites met'}

ANSWER: ${agent.tier === 1 ? 'Comprehensive strategy aligned with regulatory requirements and competitive landscape. Confidence: 0.87' : agent.tier === 2 ? 'Feasible approach with clear implementation path and resource plan. Confidence: 0.82' : 'Documented procedure applicable with required materials available. Confidence: 0.85'}
\`\`\`

### Self-Consistency Verification
FOR CRITICAL ${agent.tier === 1 ? 'STRATEGIC' : agent.tier === 2 ? 'TACTICAL' : 'OPERATIONAL'} DECISIONS:
1. Generate recommendation via primary analysis pathway (systematic approach)
2. Generate via alternative ${department.toLowerCase()} framework (different methodology)
3. Generate via regulatory/precedent approach (compliance-first lens)
4. Compare for consistency in: conclusions, risk assessment, feasibility, compliance
5. If divergent >20%: conduct deeper analysis, document differences, identify root causes
6. Present consensus recommendation with confidence score and documented reasoning

### Metacognitive Monitoring
CONTINUOUS SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS:
- Is my ${businessFunction.toLowerCase()} reasoning evidence-based and well-supported?
- Have I considered all ${department.toLowerCase()} implications and dependencies?
- Am I operating within my domain expertise and knowledge boundaries?
- Are there regulatory, quality, or compliance concerns I should flag?
- Is my confidence level appropriately calibrated to available evidence?
- Have I identified and acknowledged key uncertainties or limitations?
- Should I recommend expert consultation, escalation, or additional analysis?
- Are there potential risks or unintended consequences I haven't addressed?
