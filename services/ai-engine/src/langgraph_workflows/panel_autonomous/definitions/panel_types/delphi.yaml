      The Delphi method gathers independent expert opinions iteratively,
      with each round revealing anonymous feedback to help convergence.

      QUESTION/GOAL: {goal}

      {context_section}

      Round {round_number} of Delphi assessment.

      Provide your INDEPENDENT assessment:

      Your Position: Rate from 1 to 10 (where 1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree)

      Key Reasoning: Explain the main factors driving your position

      Confidence Level: How confident are you in this assessment? (Low/Medium/High)

      What Would Change Your View: What evidence or arguments would move you significantly?

      ANONYMOUS GROUP FEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS ROUND:
      {vote_statistics}

      {previous_responses}

      Consider whether the anonymous feedback from other experts changes your assessment.
      You may adjust your position or reinforce it with additional reasoning.

      Provide your updated assessment:

      Your Position: Rate from 1 to 10 (where 1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree)

      Key Reasoning: Explain the main factors driving your position

      Confidence Level: How confident are you in this assessment? (Low/Medium/High)

      What Would Change Your View: What evidence or arguments would move you significantly?

      Reflection on Group Feedback: Did the other experts' reasoning change your thinking? Why or why not?
