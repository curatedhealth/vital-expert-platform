      Question the assumptions. Address:

      What assumptions underlie this question? Are they valid?

      What evidence would change your view on this?

      What are we missing? What questions should we be asking instead?

      What are the implications if we are wrong?

      QUESTION/GOAL: {goal}

      {context_section}

      Round {round_number} of discussion.

      PREVIOUS ROUND RESPONSES:
      {previous_responses}

      Examine the assumptions made by other panelists. Consider:

      What assumptions did other panelists make that should be examined?

      What logical gaps exist in the reasoning presented so far?

      What alternative interpretations exist for the evidence provided?

      What questions would challenge the emerging consensus?

      What evidence would be needed to resolve the remaining uncertainties?

      Are we converging on the right questions, or should we reframe entirely?
