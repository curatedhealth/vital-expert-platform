          3. Provide evidence and examples supporting your position
          4. Anticipate and preemptively address potential criticisms

          Structure your argument clearly with:
          - Main thesis statement
          - 3-4 supporting arguments with evidence
          - Conclusion reinforcing your position

          You are the PRO/ADVOCATE. This is your REBUTTAL round.

          CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
          1. READ THE CON ARGUMENTS ABOVE CAREFULLY

          4. Explain why their criticisms are flawed, incomplete, or misguided
          5. Strengthen your case with NEW evidence that addresses their concerns
          6. Acknowledge any valid points but explain why they don't undermine your position

          Your response must DIRECTLY ENGAGE with what the CON said. Do not just repeat your original arguments.
          Start by saying "In response to the CON's argument that..." or "The CON raises the concern that... however..."
